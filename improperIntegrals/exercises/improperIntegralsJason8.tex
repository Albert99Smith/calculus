We want to determine all the values of $a$ for which the given integral is improper. 
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{x-2a} \d x
\]



Since the interval is bounded, the only way for the integral to be improper is if the integrand becomes unbounded on the region. So we can rephrase the questions as:
For which values of $a$ does the function $x-2a$ have a zero in the interval $[0,1]$? 


Give the interval of all values of $a$ for which the integral is improper:$\left[ \answer{0}, \answer{\frac{1}{2}} \right]$


\begin{feedback}[correct]

The function $x-2a$ is just a linear function that has a zero when $x=2a$. So we want values of $a$ for which $2a$ lies in the interval $[0,1]$.

 We can set up the inequality $0\leq 2a \leq 1$. Dividing all terms of the inequality by $2$ gives $0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{2}$. This means that the values of $a$ for which the above integral are improper is the interval $\left[0, \frac{1}{2} \right]$.
