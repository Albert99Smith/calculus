  trigonometric functions.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

The central idea of this section is not new. We seek to use the substitution method to help find antiderivatives, but in this section we will focus on trigonometric functions. 

We begin with a simple example.

\begin{example}
Compute:

\[
\int \sin^{2}(x) \cos(x) \d x
\]

\begin{explanation}
Here we recognize that $\cos(x)$ is the derivative of $\sin(x)$ so substitution is a good method to use. Let $u=\sin(x)$. Then $\d u=\cos(x) \d x$. 
The integral in terms of $u$ is:
\[ 
\int u^{2} \d x=\frac{u^{3}}{3}+C=\frac{ (\sin^{3})}{3}+C
\]
\end{explanation}

\end{example}


%Here are some strategies for dealing with expressions of the following
%form:
%\[
%\int \sin^n(x)\cos^m(x) \d x
%\]
%Functions like these, consisting of products of sine and cosine, can
%be antidifferentiated by using substitution and trigonometric
%identities. This process can be tedious, but the idea is
%straightforward. The basic idea in each case is to somehow take
%advantage of a trigonometric identity, usually the \dfn{Pythagorean
%  identity}:
%\[
%\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1
%\]

Now consider the following:

\begin{example}
Compute

\[ 
\int \sin^{4}(x) \cos^{3}(x) \d x 
\]

\begin{explanation}
 If $\cos(x)$ showed up to only the first power, then the substitution we used in the previous example would work. However if we split off one  $\cos(x)$ from $\cos^{3}(x)$ then we would still have a $\cos^{2}(x)$ to deal with. Recall one of our fundamental trig identities, the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\cos^{2}(x) + \sin^{2}(x)=1
\]

We can use this identity to rewrite $\cos^{2}(x)=1-\sin^{2}(x)$ in our integral so that it becomes
\[
\int \sin^{4}(x) (1-\sin^{2}(x)) \cos(x) \d x
\]
Now the same strategy we used in the first example of this section will work. We can do the substitution $u=\sin(x)$. We get $\d u= \cos(x) \d x$. 
The integral, in terms of $u$, becomes
\[ 
\int u^{4}(1-u^{2}) \d u
\]

Finishing this integral we get 

\[ 
\int u^{4}(1-u^{2}) \d u= \int u^{4}-u^{6} \d u = \frac{u^{5}}{5} - \frac{u^{7}}{7} + C =\frac{ \sin^{5}}{5} - \frac{ \sin^{7}}{7} + C
\]

\end{explanation}
\end{example}

Suppose we wanted to try to generalize this example. Our previous integral involved powers of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$. We peeled off a $\cos(x)$ term and then used $\cos^{2}(x)=1-\sin^{2}(x)$ to rewrite the remaining power of $\cos(x)$. Doing this was useful because the remaining power of $\cos(x)$ was $\cos^{2}(x)$. However this strategy would still work if the remaining power of $\cos(x)$ was any even power. For example, if the remaining power happened to be $\cos^{6}(x)$ then we could rewrite $\cos^{6}(x)=(\cos^{2}(x))^{3}$. We could then rewrite this term as $(1-\sin^{2}(x))^{3}$. 

This means that as long as the power of $\cos(x)$ in the original integral is odd, then we can peel off a $\cos(x)$ term to be used for $\d u$ and then let $u=\sin(x)$ to express the integral in terms of $u$. 

Let's try another example.

\begin{example}
Determine 

\[
\int \sin^{-2}(x)\cos^{5} \d x
\]

\begin{explanation}
Here we again have a product of powers of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$. The power of $\cos(x)$ is odd so we can peel a $\cos(x)$ term off and the remaining power $\cos^{6}(x)$ will be even. Using $\cos^{2}(x)=1-\sin^{2}(x)$, we get

\[
\int \sin^{-2}(x) (1-\sin^{2}(x))^{2} \cos(x) \d x
\]

Now we can let $u=\sin(x)$ and so $\d u= \cos(x)$. 

Now the integral becomes 

\[
\int u^{-2}(1-u^{2})^{2} \d u
\]

This integral is now in a form that we can integrate directly. 

\[
\int u^{-2}(1-u^{2})^{2} \d u=\int \frac{1+u^{4}-2u^{2}}{u^{2}} \d u= \int u^{-2}+u^{2} -2 \d u=-u^{-1}+\frac{u^{3}}{3} -2u + C
\]

Substituting back for $x$ we get :

\[
\int \sin^{-2}(x) ( 1- \sin^{2}(x))^{2} \cos(x) \d x= -\frac{1}{\sin(x)}+ \frac{ \sin^{3}(x)}{3} -2 \sin(x) +C
\]



\end{explanation}

\end{example}

\subsection{Odd powers of cosine}

The above method relies on having a power of $\sin(x)$ multiplied by odd positive power of $\cos(x)$ so we can peel off a $\cos(x)$ term and convert the remaining even positive power into a power of $1-\sin^{2}(x)$. One can then substitute $u=\sin(x)$ and $\d u= \cos(x)$ to transform the integral to be in terms of $u$. 


In general, if we are integrating a product of powers of sine and cosine, and the power
of cosine is positive and odd, then the integral looks like
\[
\int \sin^n(x) \cos^{2k+1}(x) \d x
\]
where $k$ is some nonnegative integer. Then
\begin{align*}
\int \sin^n(x) \cos^{2k+1}(x) \d x &=\int \sin^n(x) (\cos^{2}(x))^k \cos(x)\d x\\
&= \int \sin^n(x) (1-\sin^{2}(x))^k \cos(x) \d x.
\end{align*}
We have now set ourselves up for an eventual substitution:
\begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node at (0,0) {
      $\int \underbrace{( \sin^n(x) (1-\sin^{2}(x))^k} \underbrace{\cos(x) \d x}$
        };
    \node at (-.5,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
    \node at (1.8,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
so letting $u = \sin(x)$ so $\d u =\cos(x) \d x$, we have 
\[
\int u^n(1-u^2)^k \d u
\]
which is a polynomial, and can be integrated term-by-term after
expansion.

\begin{question}
  Consider the following integral:
  \[
  \int \sec^{90}(x) \cot^{59}(x)  \d x
  \]
  After making the substitution, $u = \sin(x)$ we find
  \begin{hint}
    First express secant and cotangent in terms of cosine and sine.
  \end{hint}
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$\int u^{-59}(1-u^2)^{-16} \d u$}
    \choice{$\int u^{90}(1-u^2)^{29} \d u$}
    \choice{$\int u^{29}(1-u^2)^{90} \d u$}
    \choice{$\int u^{-18}(1-u^2)^{-59} \d u$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}


\subsection{Odd powers of sine}

In a similar fashion one can use a similar method when the roles of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ are reversed. 

\begin{example}
  Compute:

  \[
  \int \sin^{5}(x) \cos^2(x) \d x
  \]

  \begin{explanation}
   
    Since the power of sine is odd, we can rewrite this suggestively as
    \begin{align*}
    \int &\sin^4(x) \cos^2(x) \sin(x) \d x \\
    &= \int (\sin^2x)^2 \cos^2(x) \sin(x) \d x
    \end{align*}
    Now using the Pythagorean identity we can rewrite everything in
    terms of $\cos(x)$, but reserve the one power of $\sin(x)$ to help
    with the differential in an eventual variable substitution $u=\cos(x)$:
    \begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0,0) {
          $\int \underbrace{(1-\cos^2(x))^2 \cos^2(x)} \underbrace{\sin(x) \d x}$
        };
        \node at (-.5,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
        \node at (1.8,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Making the substitution
    \begin{align*}
      u &= \cos(x)\\
      \d u &=\answer[given]{-\sin(x)} \d x
    \end{align*}
    yields
    \[
    \int \answer[given]{-(1-u^2)^2 u^2} \d u
    \]
    This is a polynomial in $u$, and so we can easily finish the
    integration by just expanding the polynomial out and integrating
    term-by-term. Write with me
    \begin{align*}
      \int {-(1-u^2)^2 u^2} \d u &= \int -(1-2u^2+u^4)u^2\d u\\
      &= \int-u^6 + 2u^4-u^2 \d u\\
      &=\answer[given]{-u^7/7 + 2u^5/5 - u^3/3}+C
    \end{align*}
    Substituting $u = \cos(x)$ we find our final answer:
    \[
    -\cos^7(x)/7 + 2\cos^5(x)/5 - \cos^3(x)/3+C
    \]
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

We can generalize this thinking whenever we have an odd-power of $\sin(x)$.
If we are integrating a product of powers of sine and cosine
functions, and the power of sine is odd, then the integral looks like
\[
\int \sin^{2k+1}(x) \cos^m(x) \d x
\]
where $k$ is some integer.  Then
\begin{align*}
  \int \sin^{2k+1}(x) \cos^m(x) \d x &=\int(\sin^{2}(x))^k \cos^m(x) \sin(x) \d x\\
  &= \int (1-\cos^2(x))^k \cos^m(x) \sin(x)\d x.
\end{align*}
We have now set ourselves up for an eventual substitution:
\begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node at (0,0) {
      $\int \underbrace{(1-\cos^2(x))^k \cos^m(x)} \underbrace{\sin(x) \d x}$
        };
    \node at (-.5,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
    \node at (2,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
so letting $u = \cos(x)$ so $\d u =-\sin(x) \d x$, we have
\[
\int -(1-u^2)^k u^m \d u
\]
which is a polynomial, and can be integrated term-by-term after
expansion.


\begin{question}
  Consider the following integral:
  \[
  \int \sec^{27}(x)\csc^{83}(x) \d x
  \]
  After making the substitution, $u = \cos(x)$ we find
  \begin{hint}
    First express secant and cosecant in terms of cosine and sine.
  \end{hint}\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$\int -(1-u^2)^{13} u^{83} \d u$}
    \choice{$\int -(1-u^2)^{27} u^{83} \d u$}
    \choice[correct]{$\int -(1-u^2)^{-42} u^{-27} \d u$}
    \choice{$\int -(1-u^2)^{-27} u^{-42} \d u$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}








\begin{warning}
Instead of memorizing this general result, you should focus on
internalizing the \textbf{process} by which the result was obtained.
In each case,
\begin{itemize}
\item you take off one power of a trigonometric function, and
\item you are left with an even power of that trigonometric
  function.
\end{itemize}
You can then use a Pythagorean identity to rewrite that even power in
terms of the other trigonometric functions.  Making a variable
substitution finishes the conversion to a polynomial function (or as
we will see, a rational function) in $u$.
\end{warning}



Sometimes we need to massage our function into the correct form:

\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \int \sin^5(x) \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    Write with me, we start by separating a power of sine for an eventual substitution
    \begin{align*}
      \int \sin^5 x\d x &=\int \sin^4(x) \sin(x) \d x\\
      &=\int (\sin^2(x))^2 \sin(x) \d x
    \end{align*}
    Here is what we're thinking:
    \begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0,0) {
          $\int \underbrace{(1-\cos^2(x))^2} \underbrace{\sin(x) \d x}$
        };
        \node at (-.5,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
        \node at (1.2,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Now set $u=\cos x$, $\d u=-\sin x\d x$:
    \begin{align*}
      \int \sin x (1-\cos^2 x)^2\d x&=\int \answer[given]{-(1-u^2)^2} \d u \\
      &=\int -(1-2u^2+u^4)\d u \\
      &=\answer[given]{-u+\frac{2}{3}u^3-\frac{1}{5}u^5}+C
    \end{align*}
    Hence our final answer is:
    \[
    \answer[given]{-\cos x+\frac{2}{3}\cos^3 x-\frac{1}{5}\cos^5x}+C
    \]
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

\section{When both powers are even}

Thinking again about powers of cosine and sine, what do we do when
both powers are even?  Our strategy above is sunk, since peeling-off
one power leaves an odd power, and we cannot use the Pythagorean
identity to rewrite this in a nice way.  Instead, we will use the
power-reduction formulas:

\begin{description}\index{power-reduction}
\item[Cosine Power-Reduction]: $\cos^2(x)= \frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}$\index{cosine power-reduction}
\item[Sine Power-Reduction]: $\sin^2(x) = \frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}$\index{sine power-reduction}
\end{description}

In this case, it is (usually) critical to apply the power-reduction
formulas to \textit{every} instance of cosine and sine appearing in
the integrand.

First consider a simple example:

\begin{example}
Integrate 

\[ 
\int \cos^{2}(x) \d x
\]

\begin{explanation}
We use the power reduction formula $\cos^{2}(x)=\frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}$ to tranform the integral into a form we can directly 
integrate.

\[
\int \cos^{2} (x) \d x= \frac{1}{2} \int 1+\cos(2x) \d x = \frac{1}{2} \left( x+ \frac{ \sin(2x)}{2} \right) + C
\]


\end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \int \sin^2x\cos^2x\d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation} 
    Use both power-reduction formulas to find:
    \[
    \int \sin^2x\cos^2x\d x=\int \left( \frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}\right)
    \left(\frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}\right) \d x
    \]
    From here, we can try to simplify further by multiplying out the integrand. We may end up having to
    use the power reduction formulas again to reduce the powers that appear when we multiply out the terms.  In this case
    \begin{align*}
      \int \left(\frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}\right) \left( \frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}\right) \d x &= \frac{1}{4} \int 1-\cos^2(2x) \d x\\
      &= \frac{1}{4} \int \sin^2(2x) \d x
    \end{align*}
    
    Since this expression has only even powers of sine, we must use
    the same strategy again, and employ a power-reduction formula:
    \[
    \sin^2(2x) = \frac{1-\cos(\answer[given]{4x})}{2}
    \]
    so we find
    \[
    \frac{1}{8}\int 1-\cos(4x) \d x = \answer[given]{\frac{1}{8}(x - \frac{1}{4}\sin(4x))} + C
    \]
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}




\subsection{Working with powers of $\sec(x)$ and $\tan(x)$}

One possible strategy for dealing with trigonometric integrals not of the form above is to
express every trigonometric function in terms of cosine and sine, and
then see if any of the methods previously covered will work. However, this is not the only trick up
our sleeve.  Remember, the Pythagorean identity has two other forms:
\[
1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x) \qquad\text{and}\qquad \cot^2(x) + 1 = \csc^2(x)
\]
the first identity we find by dividing the Pythagorean identity by
$\cos^2(x)$ and the second we find by dividing by $\sin^2(x)$. It is
worth seeing several examples where we use these identities. We proceed in a fashion similar to the procedures we saw earlier. We will use substitution so we need to identify $u$ and $\d u$. 



\begin{example}
  Compute
  \[
  \int \tan^3(x) \sec^4(x) \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    We recall that the derivative of $\tan(x)$ is $\sec^{2}(x)$. This suggests that we might want to try $u=\tan(x)$ which requires 
    $\d u=\sec^{2}(x)$. 
    Since the power of secant is even, we can separate off a factor of $\sec^{2}(x)$ for our $\d u$. That leaves an extra factor
    of $\sec^{2}(x)$ that we must deal with. 

    \begin{align*}
    \int &\tan^3(x) \sec^4(x) \d x \\
    &= \int\tan^3(x) \sec^2(x) \sec^2(x) \d x
    \end{align*}
    Now using the identity $1+\tan^{2}(x)=\sec^{2}(x)$ we can rewrite everything in
    terms of $\tan(x)$, but reserve the one power of $\sec^2(x)$ to help
    with the differential in an eventual variable substitution $u=\tan(x)$:
    \begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0,0) {
          $\int \underbrace{\tan^3(x)(1+\tan^2(x))} \underbrace{\sec^2(x) \d x}$
        };
        \node at (-.5,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
        \node at (1.8,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Making the substitution
    \begin{align*}
       &= \tan(x)\\
      \d u &=\answer[given]{\sec^2(x)} \d x
    \end{align*}
    yields
    \[
    \int \answer[given]{u^3(1+u^2)} \d u
    \]
    This is a polynomial in $u$, and so we can easily finish the
    integration by just expanding the polynomial out and integrating
    term-by-term. We leave it to the intrepid young mathematician to
    finish this problem.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

The key that was needed for success in this example was that the integrand was a products of powers of $\tan(x)$ and $\sec(x)$ where the power of $\sec(x)$ was positive and even.

\[
\int \tan^{m}(x) \sec^{2k}(x) \d x
\]
where $m$ is an integer and $k$ a positive integer. 

 This allowed us to separate off a $\sec^{2}(x)$ factor to use for the differential. 

\[
\int \tan^{m}(x)\sec^{2k-2}(x) \sec^{2}(x) \d x
\]

The remaining even power of $\sec(x)$ could be written as a power of $\sec^{2}(x)$. The identity $1+\tan^{2}(x)=\sec^{2}(x)$
would then allow us to rewrite the remaining $\sec(x)$ factor in terms of $\tan(x)$. 

\[
\int \tan^{m}(x) ( \sec^{2}(x))^{k-1} \sec^{2}(x) \d x=\int \tan^{m}(x) (1+\tan^{2}(x))^{k-1} \sec^{2}(x) \d x
\]

Doing the substitution $u=\tan(x)$ and $\d u=\sec^{2}(x)$, our integral becomes 

\[
\int u^{m}(1+u^{2})^{k-1} \d u
\]

The integrand is a polynomial in $u$, so in principle one can expand the polynomial and integrate the result term by term.



\begin{example}
  Compute
  \[
  \int \tan^3(x) \sec^5(x) \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    Now the power of $\sec(x)$ is not even. If we try to separate off a $\sec^{2}(x)$ term, the remaining power 
will be odd and we won't be able to rewrite it nicely in terms of $\tan(x)$.
    We try another strategy. Recall that
\[
\ddx \sec(x)=\sec(x) \tan(x)
\] 
   
   
    Since the power of tangent is odd and the power of secant is odd,
    we can pull out a $\sec(x)\tan(x)$ factor and we have
    \begin{align*}
    \int &\tan^3(x) \sec^5(x) \d x \\
    &= \int\tan^2(x) \sec^4(x) \sec(x)\tan(x) \d x
    \end{align*}
    Now using the identity $\tan^{2}(x)=\sec^{2}(x)-1$ we can rewrite the remaining $\tan^{2}(x)$ in
    terms of $\sec(x)$, but reserve the one power of $\sec(x)\tan(x)$ to help
    with the differential in an eventual variable substitution $u=\sec(x)$:
    \begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0,0) {
          $\int \underbrace{(\sec^2(x)-1)\sec^4(x)} \underbrace{\sec(x)\tan(x) \d x}$
        };
        \node at (-1,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
        \node at (1.8,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Making the substitution
    \begin{align*}
      u &= \sec(x)\\
      \d u &=\answer[given]{\sec(x)\tan(x)} \d x
    \end{align*}
    yields
    \[
    \int \answer[given]{(u^2-1)u^4} \d u
    \]
    This is a polynomial in $u$, and so we can easily finish the
    integration by just expanding the polynomial out and integrating
    term-by-term. We leave it to the interested mathematician to
    finish this problem.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

Again we can generalize the pattern in the previous problem. In order for the previous method to succeed we needed to the integrand to be a product of powers 
of $\tan(x)$ and $\sec(x)$ where the power of $\tan(x)$ is odd. 

\[
\int \tan^{2k-1}(x) \sec^{m}(x) \d x
\]


We can then pull out a $\sec(x)\tan(x)$ factor to get 

\[
\int \tan^{2k}(x) \sec^{m-1}(x) \sec(x)\tan(x) \d x
\]

Now we can rewrite the $\tan^{2k}(x)$ as the power of a square:

\[
\int (\tan^{2}(x))^{k} \sec^{m-1}(x) \sec(x)\tan(x) \d x
\]

We use the identity $\tan^{2}(x)=\sec^{2}(x)-1$ to express the $\tan^{2}(x)$ factor

\[
\int (\sec^{2}(x)-1)^{k} \sec^{m-1}(x) \sec(x)\tan(x) \d x
\]

Now we do the substitution $u=\sec(x)$ and $\d u=\sec(x)\tan(x)$. 

\[
\int (u^{2}-1)^{k} u^{m-1} \d u
\]

Yet again we have produced a polynomial in $u$ which can, in principle, be expanded and integrated term by term. 


\subsection{Powers of cosecant and cotangent}

Integrals involving powers of $\cot(x)$ and $\csc(x)$ work in a similar fashion to those involving $\tan(x)$ and $\sec(x)$. The $\cot(x)$ 
plays a role similar to $\tan(x)$ while $\csc(x)$ plays a role similar to $\sec(x)$. For completeness, we do two examples to illustrate the idea.

\begin{example}
  Compute
  \[
  \int \cot^3(x) \csc^4(x) \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    Notice that the power of $\csc(x)$ is even. Treating it just like an integral with an even power of $\sec(x)$ from 
    the previous section, we pull out a $\csc^{2}(x)$ term. 
    \begin{align*}
      \int &\cot^3(x) \csc^4(x) \d x \\
    &= \int\cot^3(x) \csc^2(x) \csc^2(x) \d x
    \end{align*}
    Now using the Pythagorean identity $\csc^{2}(x)=1+\cot^{2}(x)$, we can rewrite everything in
    terms of $\cot(x)$, but reserve the one power of $\csc^2(x)$ to use for the differential in an eventual variable substitution $u=\cot(x)$:

      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0,0) {
          $\int \underbrace{(\cot^3(x)(\cot^2(x)+1)} \underbrace{\csc^2(x) \d x}$
        };
        \node at (-.5,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
        \node at (1.8,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};

    Making the substitution
    \begin{align*}
      u &= \cot(x)\\
      \d u &=\answer[given]{-\csc^2(x)} \d x
    \end{align*}
    yields
    \[
    \int \answer[given]{-u^3(u^2+1)} \d u
    \]
    This is a polynomial in $u$, and so we can easily finish the
    integration by just expanding the polynomial out and integrating
    term-by-term. We leave it to the fearless mathematician to
    finish this problem.

\begin{example}
  Compute
  \[
  \int \cot^3(x) \csc^5(x) \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
     The power of $\csc(x)$ is not even but the power of $\cot(x)$ is odd. Mirroring the strategy we used in the 
case of a product of an odd power of $\cot(x)$ with an odd power of $\csc(x)$, we pull out a 
   $\csc(x)\cot(x)$ term to use for the differential. 
    \begin{align*}
      \int &\cot^3(x) \csc^5(x) \d x \\
    &= \int\cot^2(x) \csc^4(x) \csc(x)\cot(x) \d x
    \end{align*}
    Now using the Pythagorean identity$ \cot^{2}(x)=\csc^{2}(x)-1$ we can rewrite everything in
    terms of $\csc(x)$, but reserving the one power of $\csc(x)\cot(x)$ to help
    with the differential in an eventual variable substitution $u=\csc(x)$:
    \begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0,0) {
          $\int \underbrace{(\csc^2(x)-1)\csc^4(x)} \underbrace{\csc(x)\cot(x) \d x}$
        };
        \node at (-1,-.7) {\small{polynomial in $u$}};
        \node at (1.8,-.7) {\small{``$\d u$''}};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Making the substitution
    \begin{align*}
      u &= \csc(x)\\
      \d u &=\answer[given]{-\csc(x)\cot(x)} \d x
    \end{align*}
    yields
    \[
    \int \answer[given]{-(u^2-1)u^4} \d u
    \]
    This is a polynomial in $u$, and so we can easily finish the
    integration by just expanding the polynomial out and integrating
    term-by-term. We leave it to the patient young mathematician to
    finish this problem.

\section{Antiderivatives of other trigonometric functions}

Finally we will reveal the antiderivatives of functions like secant,
cosecant, tangent, and cotangent.

\begin{example}
Compute 

\[ 
\int \sec(x) \d x
\]
\begin{explanation}
It may not be clear why, but let's multiply the top and bottom by $\sec(x) + \tan(x)$. 

\[
\int \sec(x) \d x= \int \sec(x) \left( \frac{ \sec(x) + \tan(x)}{\sec(x)+\tan(x)} \right) \d x = \int \frac{ \sec^{2}(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)}{\sec(x)+\tan(x)} \d x
\]

Now we see the rationale behind multiplying top and bottom by $\sec(x) + \tan(x)$. The derivative of the denomiator of the integrand is precisely the numerator. 

If we let $u=\sec(x)+\tan(x)$ then $\d u=\sec(x)\tan(x)+\sec^{2}(x) \d x$ and thus our integral becomes

\[
\int \sec(x) \d x = \int \frac{1}{u} \d u=\ln|u|+C=\ln|\sec(x)+\tan(x)|+C
\]

\end{explanation}

\end{example}


%\begin{example}
%  Compute:
%  \[
%  \int \sec (x) \d x
%  \]
%  \begin{explanation}
%    Write with me
%    \begin{align*}
%      \int \sec(x) \d x &= \int \cos(x)^{-1} \d x\\
%      &= \int \cos^{-2}(x)\cos(x) \d x\\
%      &=\int(1-\sin^2(x))^{-1} \cos(x) \d x
%    \end{align*}
%    We have now set ourselves up for an eventual substitution:
%    \begin{center}%% used center instead of image since there is no reason for a LARGE integral in the text
%      \begin{tikzpicture}
%        \node at (0,0) {
%          $\int \underbrace{(1-\sin^2(x))^{-1}} \underbrace{\cos(x) \d x}$
%        };
%        \node at (-.6,-.7) {\small{rational function in $g$}};
%        \node at (1.4,-.7) {\small{``$\d g$''}};
%      \end{tikzpicture}
%    \end{center}
%    Set $g =\sin(x)$ so $\d g = \cos(x) \d x$, and write with me
%    \begin{align*}
%      \int(1-\sin^2(x))^{-1} \cos(x) \d x &= \int \frac{1}{1-g^2}\d g\\
%      &= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{1-g} + \frac{1}{1+g} \d g\
%    \end{align*}
%    Antidifferentiating we find
%    \begin{align*}
%      &=\frac{1}{2}\left(\ln(1-g) - \ln(1-g)\right)+C\\
%      &= \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+\sin(x)}{1-\sin(x)}\right)+C
%    \end{align*}
%    Note, we could stop here, but we won't because this is not the
%    typical antiderivative of $\sec(x)$. Please keep writing with me
%    \begin{align*}
%      \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+\sin(x)}{1-\sin(x)}\right)+C &= \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{(1+\sin(x))^2}{1-\sin^2(x)}\right)+C \\
%      &= \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{(1+\sin(x))^2}{\cos^2(x)}\right)+C \\
%      &= \ln\left(\frac{1+\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right)+C \\
%      &= \ln\left|\sec(x) + \tan(x)\right|+C \\
%    \end{align*}
%  \end{explanation}
%\end{example}

The strategy we employed the in the previous example will also allow us to find the antiderivatives of following trigonometric functions:


\begin{theorem}[Antiderivatives of trigonometric functions]\hfil
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\int \tan(x) \d x = -\ln|\cos(x)| + C$
  \item $\int \cot(x) \d x = \ln|\sin(x)| + C$
  \item $\int \sec(x) \d x = \ln|\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C$
  \item $\int \csc(x) \d x = -\ln|\csc(x) + \cot(x)| + C$
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

Consider the following:

\begin{example}
Compute 
\[
\int \sec^{3}(x) \d x 
\]
\begin{explanation}
Our previous techniques for handling powers of $\sec(x)$ and $\tan(x)$ relied on having an even power of $\sec(x)$ or an odd power of $\tan(x)$. 
Suppose we split off a $\sec^{2}(x)$ to write the integral as 
\[
 \int \sec(x) \sec^{2}(x) \d x
\]
The $\sec^{2}(x)$ is the antiderivative of $\tan(x)$ but there is no $\tan(x)$ term so $u$ substitution will not work. Since we have a product of two functions where one 
of the functions can be easily integrated let's try integration by parts. 

Choose
\[ 
u= \sec(x) \text{  and  } \d v=\sec^{2}(x) \\
\] 
\[
\d u=  \sec(x)\tan(x) \d x \text{  and  } v=\tan(x) 
\]

We recall the integration by parts formula $\int u \d v=uv-\int v \d u$, so we obtain

\[
\int \sec^{3}(x) \d x=\sec(x)\tan(x) - \int \tan^{2}(x)\sec(x)\d x
\]

The rightmost integral does not have an odd power of $\tan(x)$ or an even power of $\sec(x)$ but we could convert 
everything to be in terms of $\sec(x)$ by using the identity $\tan^{2}(x)=\sec^{2}(x)-1$. 

The rightmost integral then becomes
\[
\int \tan^{2}(x)\sec(x) \d x=\int (\sec^{2}(x)-1) \sec(x) \d x= \int \sec^{3}(x)\d x - \int \sec(x) \d x
\]

Combining this with our original integral and using the previous example which gave us $\int \sec(x) \d x$ we get
\[
\int \sec^{3} \d x=\sec(x) \tan(x)- \int \sec^{3} \d x + \ln| \sec(x)+\tan(x) | + C
\]

Notice that the remaining integral on the right hand side is simply the original integral we were trying to determine. You will remember that we first experienced this phenomenon in the section on integration by parts when we tried to compute $\int e^{x}\cos(x) \d x$. 
Since the desired unknown quantity appears on the left and the right we simply solve for it and so

\[
\int \sec^{3}(x) \d x=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sec(x) \tan(x) + \ln | \sec(x) + \tan(x)|  \right)  + C
\]
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

This last example can be generalized to a reduction formula for $\int \sec^{n}(x) \d x$. We omit the details but using integration by parts in a similar fashion
as above with $u=\sec^{n-2}(x)$ and $\d v=\sec^{2}(x)$ gives us the following reduction formula:

\[
\int \sec^{n}(x) \d x= \frac{\tan(x) \sec^{n-2}(x)}{n-1} + \frac{n-2}{n-1} \int \sec^{n-2}(x) \d x 
\]

We won't derive them here but note that there are similar reduction formulas that we could derive for integrating powers of other trigonometric functions using integration by parts. 

The example of $\int \sec^{3}(x) \d x$ as well as $\int \sec^{n}(x) \d x$ gives us one possible strategy to handle integrals that involve powers of $\tan(x)$ and $\sec(x)$ 
where the power of $\tan(x)$ is even and the power of $\sec(x)$ is odd. 


The idea is to write the even power of $\tan(x)$ in terms of $\sec(x)$ using 
\[ 
\tan^{2}(x)=\sec^{2}(x)-1
\]

The result will be a polynomial in $\sec(x)$. 
One can then use integral properties to break the integral up into a sum of integrals involving powers of $\sec(x)$ which can then be integrated using 
the above reduction formula.  


Note!: For many trigonometric integrals of the type we have examined in this section, there may be several techniques which apply to allow us to 
determine the antiderivative.
Consider the example
\[
\int \tan^{3}(x) \sec^{4}(x) \d x 
\]
that occured earlier in the text. When we first encountered this example, we split off a $\sec^{2}(x)$ and 
converted the leftover $\sec^{2}(x)$ term 
\[
\int \tan^{3}(x) (1+\tan^{2}(x)) \sec^{2}(x) \d x
\]

We then did the substitution $u=\tan(x)$ to convert the integrand to be a polynomial in $u$. 

Another possible strategy is to notice that the power of $\tan(x)$ is odd.  We can then use the substitution $u=sec(x)$ after pulling out a $\sec(x)\tan(x)$ term and converting 
$\tan^2(x)$ to be in terms of $\sec(x)$. 

\[
\int (\sec^{2}(x)-1) \sec^{3}(x) \sec(x)\tan(x) \d x
\]
We then do the substitution $u=\sec(x)$ to convert the integrand to be a polynomial in $u$. 

In fact there is third strategy that we can use. We  can convert the integrand to be in terms of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$. 

We get 
\[
\int \frac{\sin^{3}(x)}{\cos^{7 }(x) } \d x
\]

Here the power of $\sin(x)$ is odd so we can separate off a $\sin(x)$ to be used for $\d u$ and convert
the remaining even power of $\sin(x)$ using $\sin^{2}(x)=1-\cos^{2}(x)$. 

\[
\int \frac{(1-\cos^{2}(x)) \sin(x)}{\cos^{7}(x) } \d x
\]
The substitution $u=\cos(x)$ then converts this integral into a rational function of $u$ which can be simplified and integrated 
term by term. 
\begin{remark}
Note, it is also possible to run across trig integrals where none of these techniques immediately apply.  If all else fails, it is usually a good idea to convert all trig functions to sines and cosines.
