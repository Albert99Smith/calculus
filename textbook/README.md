# Textbook outline

* [Understanding functions](understandingFunctions/)
     - What is a function
     - Domain and range, intervals of increasing and decreasing
     - Function operations including composition
     - Basic functions: linear, polynomial, rational, roots, piecewise, absolute value
     - Emphasize piecewise (difficult for students on exams)
     - Triangle problems?
* [Review of famous functions](reviewOfFamousFunctions/)
     - quiz (in all sections) to assess understanding; say something (not in writing) emphasizing that students struggling with this quiz could move to 1150.
     - table of properties
     - some problems in homework emphasizing that you should already know all this
     - graphs, properties, algebraic properties, domain and range, idea of inverse functions
     - $e^x$, $\ln(x)$, trig functions, inverse trig functions
