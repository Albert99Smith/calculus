\title[Dig-In:]{Relating Velocity and Position}
\begin{document}

A central theme of this course has been that we can often gain a better understanding of a function by looking at its derivative, and then working backwards.  This has been our approach to max/min problems, curve sketching, linear approximation, etc.  So antiderivatives have really been important to us all along.

We have a graphical interpretation of the derivative as the slope of a tangent line at a point.  We have not yet found a graphical interpretation of the antiderivative.

\begin{question}
  The velocity of a particle is described by $V(t) = (t-1)^3$ on the interval $[0,3]$.
    \begin{question}
      Which of the following qualitatively describes the motion of the particle?
        \begin{multiple-choice}
          \item[correct]{At $t=0$ the particle is moving in the negative direction.  It slows down and stops at time $t=1$, and then begins accelerating in the positive direction.}
          \item{The particle moves in the positive direction for the whole time it is moving.}
          \item{The particle is moving in the postive direction, but slows down until it stops momentarily at $t=1$, at which time it continues moving in the positive direction.
        \end{multiple-choice}
        \begin{hint}
          Remember that velocity is the derivative of position.  In other words, the position function is an antiderivative of the velocity function.
        \end{hint}
        \begin{hint}
          The graph of $V$ looks like this %BADBAD Graph on [-0.5,3.5] x [-1.5,8.5]
        \end{hint}
        \begin{hint}
          $V$ describes the velocity of the particle.  So, at $t=0$ the particle is moving in the negative direction.  Only one choice supports this.  
        \end{hint}
    \end{question}
    
    \begin{question}
      Use repeated linear approximation to approximate the displacement of the particle from time $t=0$ to time $t=3$ using $6$ equally spaced subintervals of $[0,3]$.  Use the left endpoint of each subinterval as your approximating slope.
    \end{question}
\end{question}
