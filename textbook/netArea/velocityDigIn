\title[Dig-In:]{Relating Velocity and Position}
\begin{document}

A central theme of this course has been that we can often gain a better understanding of a function by looking at its derivative, and then working backwards.  This has been our approach to max/min problems, curve sketching, linear approximation, etc.  So antiderivatives have really been important to us all along.

We have a graphical interpretation of the derivative as the slope of a tangent line at a point.  We have not yet found a graphical interpretation of the antiderivative.

\begin{question}
  The velocity of a particle is described by $V(t) = (t-1)^3$ on the interval $[0,3]$. Let the position of the particle be given by $P(t)$.
    \begin{question}
      Which of the following qualitatively describes the motion of the particle?
        \begin{multiple-choice}
          \item[correct]{At $t=0$ the particle is moving in the negative direction.  It slows down and stops at time $t=1$, and then begins accelerating in the positive direction.}
          \item{The particle moves in the positive direction for the whole time it is moving.}
          \item{The particle is moving in the postive direction, but slows down until it stops momentarily at $t=1$, at which time it continues moving in the positive direction.
        \end{multiple-choice}
        \begin{hint}
          Remember that velocity is the derivative of position.  In other words, the position function is an antiderivative of the velocity function.
        \end{hint}
        \begin{hint}
          The graph of $V$ looks like this %BADBAD Graph on [-0.5,3.5] x [-1.5,8.5]
        \end{hint}
        \begin{hint}
          $V$ describes the velocity of the particle.  So, at $t=0$ the particle is moving in the negative direction.  Only one choice supports this.  
        \end{hint}
    \end{question}
    
    \begin{question}
      Use repeated linear approximation to approximate the displacement of the particle from time $t=0$ to time $t=3$ using $6$ equally spaced subintervals of $[0,3]$.  Use the left endpoint of each subinterval as your approximating slope.
      
      \[P(3) - P(0) \approx \answer{\frac{27}{18}}\]
      
      \begin{hint}
        \begin{align*}
        P(3) - P(0) &= (P(3) - P(2.5))+(P(2.5) - P(2))+ (P(2) - P(1.5))+ (P(1.5) - P(1))+(P(1) -P(0.5))+(P(0.5) - P(0))\\
        &\approx \frac{1}{2}P'(2.5)+\frac{1}{2}P'(2) +\frac{1}{2}P'(1.5)+\frac{1}{2}P'(1)+\frac{1}{2}P'(0.5)+\frac{1}{2}P'(0)
        
        \end{align*}
      \end{hint}
      \begin{hint}
        \begin{align*}
          \hphantom{P(3) - P(0)} &= \frac{1}{2}V(2.5)+\frac{1}{2}V(2) +\frac{1}{2}V(1.5)+\frac{1}{2}V(1)+\frac{1}{2}V(0.5)+\frac{1}{2}V(0)\\
          &= \frac{1}{2} ( (1.5)^3+ (1)^3 + (0.5)^3+0^3+(-0.5)^3+(-1)^3 )\\
          &= \frac{27}{18}
        \end{align*}
        
        Isn't it kind of cool how all of the terms but one canceled out?  This is really because of the symmetry of the velecity function about the point $t=1$.  Basically, the particle exactly recovers its path from $t=0$ to $t=1$ when it travels from $t=1$ to $t=2$, and it ends up where it starts at $t=2$.  So only the motion of the particle over the domain $[2,3]$ contributes to the displacement.
      \end{hint}
