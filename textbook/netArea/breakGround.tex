% Harvard calculus left the mean value theorem out.

% How is this related to the "racetrack principle"?

A dialogue where students discuss net area.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Walk forward. walk backward.  how far have you gone?
\item[Riley] Let's draw a picture of me.
\end{dialogue}

% Find the exact area under the curve
% Idea of Net Area
% Find Net Area
% Idea of splitting the area if trying to find total area
% Idea of Distance being Net Area of Velocity

% "net change"

% some curve of velocity

% distance versus displacement

% emphasize splitting area to find total area under curve
