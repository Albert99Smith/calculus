\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use limits of Riemann sums to find the exact area under a curve.
	\item Define net area.
	\item Approximate net area.
	\item Understand how Riemann sums are used to find exact area.
	\item Split the area under a curve into several pieces to aid with calculations.
	\item Use symmetry to calculate definite integrals.
	\item Explain geometrically why symmetry of a function simplifies calculation of some definite integrals.
	\item Approximate displacement from velocity.
\end{itemize}
