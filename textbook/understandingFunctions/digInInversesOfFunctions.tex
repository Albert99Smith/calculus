If a function maps every ``input'' to exactly one ``output,'' an
inverse of that function maps every ``output'' to exactly one
``input.''  We need a more formal definition to actually say anything
with rigor.

\begin{definition}
  Let $f$ be a function with domain $A$ and range $B$:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[star,star points=7,star point ratio=2.5,draw] at (0,0) {$A$};
      \node[cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, inner ysep=1em] at (5,0) {$B$};
      \node at (2.25,.3) {$f$};
      \draw[->] (1.5,0) to (3,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  Let $g$ be a function with domain $B$ and range $A$:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, inner ysep=1em] at (-.5,0) {$B$};
      \node[star,star points=7,star point ratio=2.5,draw] at (4.5,0) {$A$};
      \node at (2.25,.3) {$g$};
      \draw[->] (1.5,0) to (3,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  We say that $f$ and $g$ are \dfn{inverses} of each other if $f(g(b))
  = b$ for all $b$ in $B$, and also $g(f(a)) = a$ for all $a$ in $A$.
  Sometimes we write $g = f^{-1}$ in this case.
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, inner ysep=1em] at (-.5,0) {$B$};
      \node[cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, inner ysep=1em] at (5,0) {$B$};
      \node at (2.25,.3) {$f(f^{-1})$};
      \draw[->] (1.5,0) to (3,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  and
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[star,star points=7,star point ratio=2.5,draw] at (0,0) {$A$};
      \node[star,star points=7,star point ratio=2.5,draw] at (4.5,0) {$A$};
      \node at (2.25,.3) {$f^{-1}(f)$};
      \draw[->] (1.5,0) to (3,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  So we could rephrase the conditions as
  \[
  f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\qquad\text{and}\qquad f^{-1}(f(x)) = x.
  \]
  \end{definition}
These two simple equations are somewhat more subtle than they
initially appear.

\begin{question}
  Let $f$ be a function.  If the point $(1,9)$ is on the graph of $f$,
  what point must be the the graph of $f^{-1}$?	
  \[
  \left( \answer[given]{9}, \answer[given]{1} \right)
  \]
  \begin{feedback}
    Since $f(1) = 9$, we must have $f^{-1}(f(1)) = 1$, so $f^{-1}(9) =
    1$.  Thus $(9,1)$ is on the graph of $f^{-1}$.  This is a general
    rule.  If $(a,b)$ is on the graph of $f$, and $(b,a)$ will be the
    graph of $f^{-1}$.
  \end{feedback}
\end{question}

\begin{warning}
  Keep a watchful eye:
  \begin{align*}
    f^{-1}(x) &= \text{the inverse function of $f(x)$.}\\
    f(x)^{-1} &= \text{$\frac{1}{f(x)}$.}
  \end{align*}
\end{warning}
\begin{question}
  Which of the following represents the inverse of the function
  $\sin(\theta)$ on the interval $[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$\sin^{-1}(\theta)$}
    \choice{$\sin(\theta)^{-1}$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}


While this might sound somewhat esoteric, let's see
if we can ground this in some real-life contexts.

\begin{example}
  The the following function
  \[
  f(t) = \left(\frac{9}{5}\right) t + 32
  \]	
  is the function which takes Celsius measurements (its domain is
  $-\infty < t < \infty$) and converts them to Fahrenheit
  measurements of temperature.  What does the inverse of this function
  tell you? What is the inverse of this function?

  \begin{explanation}
    If $f$ converts Celsius measurments to Fahrenheit measurements of
    temperature, then $f^{-1}$ converts Fahrenheit measurments to
    Celsius measurments of temperature. First note that 
    \[
    f(f^{-1}(t)) = t \qquad \text{by the definition of inverse
      functions.}
    \]
    Now write out the left-hand side of the equation
    \[
    f(f^{-1}(t)) = \left(\frac{9}{5}\right) f^{-1}(t)+32\qquad\text{by the rule for $f$}
    \]
    and solve for $f^{-1}(t)$.
    \begin{align*}
      \left(\frac{9}{5}\right) f^{-1}(t)+32 &= t &&\text{by the rule for $f$}\\
      \left(\frac{9}{5}\right) f^{-1}(t)&= t -32\\
      f^{-1}(t) &= \left(\frac{5}{9}\right)(t - 32).
    \end{align*}
    So $f^{-1}(t) = \left(\frac{5}{9}\right)(t - 32)$ is the inverse
    function of $f$, which converts a Fahrenheit measurement back into
    a Celsius measurement and has a domain of $-\infty < t <\infty$.
    Finally note that
    \[
    f(f^{-1}(t)) = t,
    \]
    since we solved for $f^{-1}$ to ensure this is so, and that
    \begin{align*}
    f^{-1}(f(t)) &=\left(\frac{5}{9}\right)(f(t) - 32)\\
    &= \left(\frac{5}{9}\right)(f(t) - 32)\\
    \end{align*}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}






\begin{question}
  Let $f$ be a function, and imagine that the points $(2,3)$ and
  $(7,3)$ are both on its graph.  Could $f$ have an inverse function?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Yes}
    \choice[correct]{No}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
    The function $f$ could \textbf{not} have an inverse function.
    Imagine that it did.  Then $f^{-1}(f(2)) = 2$ and $f^{-1}(f(7)) =
    7$.  Then we have both $f^{-1}(3) = 2$ and $f^{-1}(3) = 7$.  Since
    a \textbf{function} cannot send the same input to two different
    outputs, $f$ must not have an inverse function.
  \end{feedback}
\end{question}

The last question highlights something interesting about inverse functions.  If two different inputs into a function have the same output, there is no hope  of that function having an inverse, since a function can only have one output.  This leads us to the following definition:

\begin{definition}
A function is \dfn{one-to-one} if for every value in the range,
there is exactly one value in the domain.
\end{definition}


\begin{question}
Which of the following functions are one to one?  Select all that
apply.
\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{$f(x) = x$}
\choice{$f(x) = x^2$}
\choice{$f(x) = x^3 - 4x$}
\choice[correct]{$f(x) = x^3+4$}
\end{selectAll}
\end{question}

You may recall that a plot gives $y$ as a function of $x$ if every
vertical line crosses the plot at most once, this is commonly known as
the \dfn{vertical line test}. At this point the function is one-to-one
if every horizontal line crosses the plot at most once, which is
commonly known as the \dfn{horizontal line test}. Below we give a plot
of $f(x)=-5x^2+30x+60$. While this plot passes the vertical line test,
and hence represents $y$ as a function of $x$, it does not pass the
horizontal line test, so the function is not one-to-one.
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            clip=false, domain=0:7.58, axis lines =middle, xlabel=$t$,
            ylabel=$h$, every axis y label/.style={at=(current
              axis.above origin),anchor=south}, every axis x
            label/.style={at=(current axis.right of
              origin),anchor=west}, ] \addplot [very thick, penColor,
            smooth] {-5*x^2 +30*x+60}; \addplot [very thick,
            penColor2] {80}; \addplot [very thick, penColor4] plot
          coordinates {(5,0) (5,110)};
        \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}


We can only find an inverse to a function when it is one-to-one,
otherwise we must restrict the domain. Let's see what this means in
our next example.

\begin{example}
Consider the function
\[
f(x) = x^2.
\]
Does $f$ have an inverse? If so what is it? If not, attempt to
restrict the domain of $f$ and find an inverse on the restricted
domain.
\end{example}


\begin{explanation}
In this case $f$ is not one-to-one. However, it is one-to-one on
the interval $[0,\infty)$. Hence we can find an inverse of $f(x)=x^2$
  on this interval, and it is our familiar function $\sqrt{x}$.  
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            domain=-2:2,
            xmin=-2, xmax=2,
            ymin=-2, ymax=2,
            axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          ]

          \addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth, samples=100,domain=0:2] {sqrt(x)};
          \addplot [dashed, textColor] {x};
          \node at (axis cs:-1.2,.55) [penColor,anchor=west] {$f(x)$};
          \node at (axis cs:1.4,1) [penColor2, anchor=west] {$f^{-1}(x)$};
        \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

Let's look at several examples.



\begin{example}
Consider the function
\[
f(x) = x^3.
\]
Does $f(x)$ have an inverse? If so what is it? If not, attempt to
restrict the domain of $f(x)$ and find an inverse on the restricted
domain.
\begin{explanation}
In this case $f(x)$ is one-to-one and $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$. See Figure~\ref{plot:fxn and inverse x^3}.
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            domain=-2:2,
            xmin=-2, xmax=2,

            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},

v(t) = 700t + 200 
\]
for $0\le t \le V$ where $V$ is the maximum volume of the pool. What
does the inverse of this function tell you? What is the inverse of
this function?
\begin{explanation}
While $v(t)$ tells you how many gallons of water are in the pool after
a period of time $t$, the inverse of $v$ tells you how much time must
be spent to obtain a given volume. To compute the inverse function,
first note that
\[
v(v^{-1}(t)) = t.
\]
Now write out the left-hand side of the equation
\[
v(v^{-1}(t)) = 700\cdot v^{-1}(t) + 200 
\]
and solve for $v^{-1}(t)$
\begin{align*}
  700\cdot v^{-1}(t) + 200 &= t,\\
  700\cdot v^{-1}(t)  &= t-200\\
  v^{-1}(t) &= \frac{t-200}{700}.
\end{align*}
This is a function that maps volume in gallons to time in hours. 
\end{explanation}
\end{example}




Let's look at how tables of values for functions and their inverses
compare.  For this example, we have:
%% insert picture 7
These tables reinforce the fact that our inputs become our outputs and vice versa.  We see that when the input for the function is $0$ the output is $200$ and when the input for the inverse is $200$, the output is $0$.  This isn't a coincidence.  This leads us to the face that the plot of the inverse is the plot of the function reflected over the line $y=x$ or $f(x)=x$.  See figure.
%% Insert picture 8

Now let's consider a different example.

\begin{example}\label{E:example-ball-bridge}
Suppose you are standing on a bridge that is 60 meters above
sea-level. You toss a ball up into the air with an initial velocity of
30 meters per second.  If $t$ is the time (in seconds) after we toss
the ball, then the height at time $t$ is approximately $h(t) = -5 t^2
+30t+60$. What does the inverse of this function tell you? What is the inverse
of this function?
\begin{explanation}
While $h(t)$ tells you how the height the ball is above sea-level at an
instant of time, the inverse of $h(t)$ tells you what time it is when
the ball is at a given height. There is only one problem: There is no
function that is the inverse of $h(t)$. Consider Figure~\ref{plot:fxn
  ball}, we can see that for some heights---namely 60 meters, there
are two times. This plot fails the horizontal line test to determine if the function is one-to-one.  Since the plot is not one-to-one, we cannot find an inverse function for $h(t)$.

While there is no inverse function for $h(t)$, we can find one if we
\textit{restrict the domain} of $h(t)$.  Looking at the plot of $h(t)$, we see that it can pass the horizontal line test if we restrict the domain to half of the parabola.  The point at which we need to split the parabola is at the vertex. See figure.
%% Insert original figure 7 but with bolded point at vertex

To find the vertex, we need to write the equation in standard parabola form by completing the square.

\begin{align*}
h &= -5t^2+30t+60\\
h &=-5\left((t^2-6t+9)-12-9\right)\\
h &=-5\left((t-3)^2-21\right)\\
h &=-5(t-3)^2+105
\end{align*}

Therefore the vertex is $(3,105)$

Now we can find the inverse on the interval $[3,\infty)$.

Note: We have added and subtracted $9$ at the same time because that's
equivalent to adding $0$.  The reason we have chosen 9 is by the
completing the square process.  If we have a quadratic in the form
$t^2-bt+c$, we need to find $(\frac {b}{2})^2$.  In this case,
$(\frac{-6}{2})^2 =9$.

From the standard form of the parabola: $h = -5(t-3)^2+105$ we can find the inverse.
\begin{align*}
h-105 &= -5(t-3)^2\\
\frac {h-105}{-5} &= (t-3)^2\\
\pm \sqrt{\frac {h-105}{-5}} &=t-3\\
3 \pm \sqrt{\frac {h-105}{-5}} &=t\\
3 \pm \sqrt{21-.2h} &=t 
\end{align*}

An alternate method to finding the inverse would be: 
Write
\begin{align*}
h &=  -5 t^2 +30t+60\\
0 &= -5 t^2 +30t+(60 - h)
\end{align*}
and solve for $t$ using the quadratic formula
\begin{align*}
t &= \frac{-30\pm \sqrt{30^2 -4(-5)(60-h)}}{2(-5)}\\
&= \frac{-30\pm \sqrt{30^2 +20(60-h)}}{-10}\\
&=3\mp \sqrt{3^2+ .2(60-h)}\\
&=3\mp \sqrt{9+ .2(60-h)}\\
&=3\mp \sqrt{21-.2h}
\end{align*}

But now we have two equations:
$t=3+ \sqrt{21-.2h}$
$t=3- \sqrt{21-.2h}$

We need to determine which equation should be used when $t>3$.
 Since $h(t)$ has its maximum value
  of $105$ when $t=3$, the largest $h$ could be is $105$. This means
  that $21-.2h \ge 0$ and so $\sqrt{21-.2h}$ is a real number. We know
  something else too, $t>3$. This means that the ``$\mp$'' that we see
  above must be a ``$+$.''  So the inverse of $h(t)$ on the interval
  $[3,\infty)$ is $t(h) = 3+ \sqrt{21-.2h}$. A similar argument will
    show that the inverse of $h(t)$ on the interval $(-\infty, 3]$ is
  $t(h) = 3- \sqrt{21-.2h}$.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}
