  Here we see two young mathematicians examining one (or two!)
  functions.

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I have a pressing question.
\item[Riley] Tell me. Tell me everything.
\item[Devyn] Think about the function
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 3x + 2}{x-2}.
  \]
\item[Riley] OK.
\item[Devyn] Is this function equal to $g(x) = x+1$?
\item[Riley] Well if I plot them with my calculator, they look the
  same.
\item[Devyn] I know!
\item[Riley] And I suppose if I write
  \begin{align*}
    f(x) &= \frac{x^2 - 3x + 2}{x-2} \\
    &= \frac{(x-1)(x-2)}{x-2} \\
    &= x-1 \\
    &= g(x).
  \end{align*}
\item[Devyn] Sure! But what about when $x=2$? In this case
  \[
  g(2) = 1\qquad\text{but}\qquad f(2) \text{ is undefined!}.
  \]
\item[Riley] Hmm. Now I see the problem. Yikes!
