%% \item[Devyn] Riley, I've been thinking about angry values.
%% \item[Riley] What do you mean?
%% \item[Devyn] Oh, yeah, yeah, I meant mean values.

% Use racetrack principle 

% rigorously translating infinitesimal data into data on points

% Rolle's theorem

% I drove to Urbana-Champaign in 5 hours; it's 300 miles away, so I was going 60 mph.

% But were you STOPPED at the beginning and STOPPED at the end?  So you must have been going faster than 60mph at some point.

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I want to go to math class. Now. Let's race!
\item[Riley] Yes. I love math class. Let's do race! On, your
  mark\dots. Ready. Steady. Go!
\item[Devyn] You may think you're fast, but I'm catching up!
\item[Riley] Noooooo!
\item[Devyn] Now I'm winning! I've never won a foot race in my life!
\item[Riley] Never\dots give\dots up!
\item[Devyn] Whew! We both made it to math class at exactly the same
  time!
\item[Riley] Wow. We should run to every class. Hey I have a question,
  was there a time during our race that we were running at exactly the
  same speed?
