% BADBAD This is not done

% Harvard calculus left the mean value theorem out.

% How is this related to the "racetrack principle"?

A dialogue where students discuss the mean value theorem.

\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I've been thinking about angry values.
\item[Riley] What do you mean?
\item[Devyn] Oh, yeah, yeah, I meant mean values.
\end{dialogue}

% Use racetrack principle 

% rigorously translating infinitesimal data into data on points

% Rolle's theorem

% I drove to Urbana-Champaign in 5 hours; it's 300 miles away, so I was going 60 mph.

% But were you STOPPED at the beginning and STOPPED at the end?  So you must have been going faster than 60mph at some point.
