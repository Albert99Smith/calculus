\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I want to go to math class. Now. Let's race!
\item[Riley] Yes. I love math class. Let's do race! On, your
  mark\dots. Ready. Steady. Go!
\item[Devyn] You may think you're fast, but I'm catching up!
\item[Riley] Noooooo!
\item[Devyn] Now I'm winning! I've never won a foot race in my life!
\item[Riley] Never\dots give\dots up!
\item[Devyn] Whew! We both made it to math class at exactly the same
  time!
\item[Riley] Wow. We should run to every class. Hey I have a question,
  was there a time during our race that we were running at exactly the
  same speed?
