\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use integral notation for both antiderivatives and definite integrals.
	\item Compute definite integrals using limits of Riemann Sums.
	\item Compute definite integrals using geometry.
	\item Compute definite integrals using the properties of integrals.
	\item Justify the properties of definite integrals using algebra or geometry.
	\item Understand how Riemann sums are used to find exact area.
	\item Generalize the process of taking a Riemann sum so that the intervals need not be equally spaced.
\end{itemize}
