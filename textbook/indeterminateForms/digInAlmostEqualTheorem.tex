%This chapter will consist of three dig in's 1. The Almost Equal Theorem 2. Limits of the form non-zero over zero 3. Determinate and indeterminate forms 

In the last section, we were interested in the limits we could compute
using continuity and the limit laws, but what about the limits that
cannot be directly computed using these methods?  Is it possible to
determine these limits?  Often times, it is.  We will use two
important tools to find these limits.  The first is the following
theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Almost Equal Theorem]
Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions such that $f(x)=g(x)$ for every x in
some open interval $I$ except for at some point $a$ in $I$.  Then,
$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)= \lim_{x\to a} g(x)$, provided at least one of
these limits exists.  We call $f$ and $g$ \textbf{almost equal
  functions} in the context of considering the limit as $x$ approaches
$a$.
\end{theorem}

That is, if two functions agree at every point near $a$, then they
have the same limit at $a$.  This should make sense since we already
know that the limit does not care about what is happening exactly at
$a$.

Let's consider an example that we looked at in the previous section:

\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \lim_{x\to 2}\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2}
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    In the previous section, we decided that we could not find this
    limit using the Quotient Law because the denominator is equal to 0
    at $x=2$.  Can we use the Almost Equal Thoerem? Can we find an
    equation that has the same outputs as $\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2}$ at
    every value of $x$ except $x=2$?
    
    Notice that the numerator of this fraction can be factored to give us:
    \[
    \frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2} =  \frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{(x-2)} \stackrel{?}{=}\frac{\cancel{(x-2)}(x-1)}{\cancel{(x-2)}}=x-1
    \]
    It is very tempting to automatically cancel the $(x-2)$ term out
    of the top and bottom of the fraction, but can we?  In fact, this
    is what we are going to do, but we need to be clear about what we
    are doing when we cancel that term.  By canceling out the $(x-2)$,
    we will be changing the domain of the function.  The domain of
    $\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{(x-2)}$ is $(-\infty,2)\cup(2,\infty)$, but the
    domain of $(x-1)$ is $(-\infty,\infty)$.  More specifically,
    $(x-1)$ is continuous for all real numbers, but
    $\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{(x-2)}$ is discontinuous at $x=2$.
 
 %insert graphs of $\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{(x-2)}$ and $(x-1)$ side by side.
 
    We have found a function that agrees with
    $\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{(x-2)}$ everywhere except at $x=2$.  While
    \[
    \frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{(x-2)} \neq x-1,
    \]
    we can use our theorem to say that the limits are equal.
    Therefore, we have:
    \[
    \lim_{x\to 2}\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2} = \lim_{x\to 2} (x-1) = 2-1 =1.
    \]
    %\marginnote[-1in]{Limits allow us to examine functions where they are not defined.}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example} 

This trick does not always work.  For example, consider
\[
\lim_{x\to 3}\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-3}.
\]
First note that if we plug $3$ into the denominator of this fraction,
the denominator will equal $0$.  Therefore, we cannot use the Quotient
Law to solve this problem.  Factoring will give us
$\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-3}=\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{x-3}$ and nothing cancels.  We
seem to be stuck.  We need to develop some new tools and come back to
this example.

In order to give us a concrete way of talking about the differences
between these two examples, we are going to introduce a new idea, the
form of a limit.

\begin{definition}
  Consider
  \[
  \lim_{x\to a}f(x).
  \]
  The \dfn{form} of this limit is a symbol which is not a number that
  results when $a$ is plugged directly into $f(x)$ and the result is
  simplified as much as possible.  Because a form is not a number, we
  will not say that a limit equals its form.  We will use the symbol
  $\sim$ to say that a limit has a certain form.
\end{definition} 

Consider the first example.
\[
\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2} \sim \frac{(2)^2-3(2)+2}{(2)-2} \sim \frac{0}{0}.
\]
This is a limit of the form $\frac{0}{0}$.  Knowing this form is
informative.  Since we know that both the numerator and the
denominator are approaching $0$ as $x$ approaches $2$, we suspect that
there might be a common factor in both the top and the bottom which
are going to $0$.  If we could find that factor and cancel it, we would
have a function which is almost equal to the original function and
whose limit we may be able to find using the Limit Laws.  In fact,
this is exactly what happened in this example when we factored out the
$(x-2)$ term.

Now consider again
\[
\lim_{x\to 3}\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-3} \sim \frac{(3)^2-3(3)+2}{(3)-3} \sim \frac{5}{0}.
\]
This limit has the form $\frac{5}{0}$, which immediately tell us that
there cannot be a factor $(x-3)$ which can be factored out of the
denominator.  In fact, it tells us more than that.  We will look at
how to solve limits with a form $\frac{\text{non-zero}}{\text{zero}}$
in the next dig in.

For now, lets consider some more examples of the form $\frac{0}{0}$.

\begin{example}
$\lim_{x\to1}\frac{x^2+2x-3}{x-1}$. 
\begin{explanation}
We begin by finding the form of this limit.
\[
\lim_{x\to1}\frac{x^2+2x-3}{x-1} \sim \frac{(1)^2+2(1)-3}{(1)-1} \sim
\frac{0}{0}.
\]
This tells us we can likely find an almost equal function if we can
cancel a term going to $0$ out of the numerator and denominator.  Since
$(x-1)$ is a term going to $0$ in the denominator, let's see if we can
factor a $(x-1)$ out of the numerator as well.
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to1}{x^2+2x-3\over x-1}&=\lim_{x\to1}{(x-1)(x+3)\over x-1} \\
&=\lim_{x\to1}(x+3)=4
\end{align*}
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \lim_{x\to1}\frac{x^2+2x-4}{x-2}
  \]
\begin{explanation}
  We begin by finding the form of this
  limit.
  \[
  \lim_{x\to1}\frac{x^2+2x-4}{x-2} \sim\frac{(1)^2+2(1)-4}{(1)-2} \sim \frac{-1}{-1}.
  \]
  This is a numeber, not an indeterminate form! We have discovered
  that this is a limit for which we could have and should have used
  the continuity of rational functions on their domains to compute
  this limit.  All we have to do is change our $\sim$ symbols to $=$
  symbols to complete the problem.
  \[
  \lim_{x\to1}\frac{x^2+2x-4}{x-2} = \frac{(1)^2+2(1)-4}{(1)-2} =
  \frac{-1}{-1} =1.
  \]
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{3}{x+5}}{x-1}
  \]
\begin{explanation}
  We begin by finding the form of this limit.
  \[
  \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{3}{x+5}}{x-1} \sim
  \frac{\frac{1}{(1)+1}-\frac{3}{(1)+5}}{(1)-1} \sim
  \frac{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}}{0} \sim \frac{0}{0}
  \]
This tells us that we can probably factor a term going to $0$ out of
both the numerator and denominator.  We suspect from looking at the
denominator that this term is $(x-1)$.  Unfortunately, it is not
immediately obvious how to factor an $(x-1)$ out of the numerator.  In
order to simplify the numerator, we will find a common denominator for
the fractions in the numerator.
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to 1} \frac{\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{3}{x+5}}{x-1}  &= \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{\frac{1}{x+1} \cdot \frac{x+5}{x+5}-\frac{3}{x+5} \cdot \frac{x+1}{x+1}}{x-1}\\
&= \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{\frac{(x+5)-3(x+1)}{(x+1)(x+5)}}{x-1}\\
&= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{(x+5)-3(x+1)}{(x+1)(x+5)} \cdot \frac{1}{x-1}\\
&= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{(x+5)-3(x+1)}{(x+1)(x+5)(x-1)}
\end{align*}

Now we will multiply out the numerator.  Note that we do not want to
multiply out the denominator because we already have an $(x-1)$
factored out of the denominator and that was the goal.

\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{(x+5)-3(x+1)}{(x+1)(x+5)(x-1)} &= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x+5-3x-3}{(x+1)(x+5)(x-1)} \\
&= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{-2x+2}{(x+1)(x+5)(x-1)}\\
&= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{-2(x-1)}{(x+1)(x+5)(x-1)}\\
&= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{-2\cancel{(x-1)}}{(x+1)(x+5)\cancel{(x-1)}}\\
&= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{-2}{(x+1)(x+5)}.
\end{align*}
  
Now we finally have an almost equal function that is continuous at
$x=1$.

\[
\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{-2}{(x+1)(x+5)} = \frac{-2}{((1)+1)((1)+5)} = \frac{-2}{12} = \frac{-1}{6}
\]
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \lim_{x\to-1} \frac{\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1}
  \]

\begin{explanation} 
  We begin by finding the form of this limit.
  \[
  \lim_{x\to-1} \frac{\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1} \sim \frac{\sqrt{(-1)+5}-2}{(-1)+1} \sim \frac{\sqrt{4}-2}{0} \sim \frac{0}{0}.
  \]
  This tells us that we can probably factor a term going to $0$ out of
  both the numerator and denominator.  We suspect from looking at the
  denominator that this term is $(x+1)$.  Unfortunately, it is not
  immediately obvious how to factor an $(x+1)$ out of the numerator.
 
  We will use an algebraic technique called \textbf{multiplying by the
    conjugate}.  This technique is useful when you are trying to
  simplify an expression that looks like
  \[
  \sqrt{\text{something} \pm \text{something else}}.
  \]
  It takes advantage of the difference of squares rule that
  \[
  a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b).
  \]
  In our case, we will use $a=\sqrt{x+5}$ and $b=2$.  Then, we have
  the $(a-b)$ term.  If we introduce the $(a+b)$ term by multiplying
  both the numerator and denonimator by $(\sqrt{x+5}+2)$, we will be
  able to simpify our result using the differences of squares.
 
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to-1} \frac{\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1}&=
\lim_{x\to-1} \frac{(\sqrt{x+5}-2)}{(x+1)} \cdot \frac{(\sqrt{x+5}+2)}{(\sqrt{x+5}+2)} \\
&=\lim_{x\to-1} \frac{(\sqrt{x+5})^2-(2)^2}{(x+1)(\sqrt{x+5}+2)} \\
&=\lim_{x\to-1} {x+5-4\over (x+1)(\sqrt{x+5}+2)} \\
&=\lim_{x\to-1} {(x+1)\over (x+1)(\sqrt{x+5}+2)} \\
&=\lim_{x\to-1} {\cancel{(x+1)}\over \cancel{(x+1)}(\sqrt{x+5}+2)} \\
&=\lim_{x\to-1} {1\over \sqrt{x+5}+2}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{-1+5}+2}={1\over4}.
\end{align*}
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

All the examples in this section use the Almost Equal Theorem to
compute limits of the form $\frac{0}{0}$.  When you come across a
limit of the form $\frac{0}{0}$, you should try to use various algebra
techniques to come up with an almost equal function whose limit you
can evaluate.

Notice that we solved multiple examples of limits of the form
$\frac{0}{0}$ and we got different answers each time.  This tells us
that just knowing the form of the limit is $\frac{0}{0}$ is not enough
to compute the limit.

\begin{definition}
Forms which do not give us enough information to know the answer to
the limit from just looking at the form are called \dfn{indeterminate
  forms}.  There are some forms which we will see in future sections
which will be able to tell us the answer to the limit from just
looking at the form. These forms are called \dfn{determinate forms}.
\end{definition}  

The form $\frac{0}{0}$ is an indeterminate form.
