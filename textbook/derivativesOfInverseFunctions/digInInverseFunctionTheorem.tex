There is one catch to the explanations given above. To write
\[
\ddx(e^y)=e^y\cdot y'
\]
we need to know that the function $y$ \textit{has} a derivative. All
we have shown is that \textit{if} it has a derivative then that
derivative must be $1/x$. The \textit{Inverse Function Theorem}
guarantees this.

\begin{theorem}[Inverse Function Theorem]\index{Inverse Function Theorem}\label{theorem:IFT}
If $f$ is a differentiable function, and $f'$ is continuous, and
$f'(a) \neq 0$, then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f^{-1}(x)$ is defined for $x$ near $f(a)$,
\item $f^{-1}(x)$ is differentiable near $f(a)$, 
\item $\dd{x} f^{-1}(x)$ is continuous near $f(a)$, and
\item last, but not least:
  \[
  \dd{x} f^{-1}(x)  = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}.
  \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
