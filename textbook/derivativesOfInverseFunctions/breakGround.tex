\title[Break-Ground:]{Derivatives of inverse functions}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we see a dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss inverse functions.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students:

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] I'm going to differentiate $\sin^{-1} x$
\item[Riley] Let's use the chain rule.
\item[Devyn] Now I apply the power rule.
\item[Riley] Is that right?
\end{dialogue}

% This gets at what the notation sin^{-1} x means, and what the inverse function theorem is saying

% Contrast it with a geometric interpretation that since the inverse is the fxn flipped over the line y=x, we should have this info once we know f'

% becaue we want to actually have two answers that both seem reasonable and demand that they student resolve the contradiction in mathematics
