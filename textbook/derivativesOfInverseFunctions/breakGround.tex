Two young mathematicians discuss the derivative of inverse functions.

\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students:

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I have a calculus question.
\item[Riley] Hit me with it.
\item[Devyn] What's the derivative of $\arctan(x)$?
\item[Riley] Hmmm\dots we haven't done it yet in our class.
\item[Devyn] I know! But maybe we can figure it out.
\item[Riley] Well
  \[
  \arctan(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)
  \]
  and now we can use the chain rule to take its derivative
  \begin{align*}
    \ddx \tan^{-1}(x) &= -\tan^{-2}(x)\sec^2(x)\\
    &= -\frac{\cos^2x}{\sin^2x}\cdot \frac{1}{\cos^2x}\\
    &= \frac{-1}{\sin^2x}.
  \end{align*}
\item[Devyn] But is this right?
\end{dialogue}

% This gets at what the notation sin^{-1} x means, and what the inverse function theorem is saying

% Contrast it with a geometric interpretation that since the inverse is the fxn flipped over the line y=x, we should have this info once we know f'

% becaue we want to actually have two answers that both seem reasonable and demand that they student resolve the contradiction in mathematics
