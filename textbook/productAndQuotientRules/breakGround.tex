Here we see a dialogue where young mathematicians talk about products
of derivatives.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Hey Riley, remember the sum rule for derivatives?
\item[Riley] You know it.
\item[Devyn] What do you think that the ``product rule'' will be?
\item[Riley] Maybe
  \[
  \dd{x} \left(f(x)\cdot g(x)\right) = f'(x) \cdot g'(x)?
  \]
