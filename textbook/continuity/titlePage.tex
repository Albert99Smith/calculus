\begin{sectionOutcomes}
After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify where a function is and is not continuous.
	\item List common continuous functions such as trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and polynomials.
	\item Compute limits using continuity.
	\item Understand what it means for a function to be continuous.
	\item Identify when a function is right- or left-continuous at the endpoints of a closed interval.
	\item Understand the connection between continuity of a function and the value of a limit.
	\item State the Intermediate Value Theorem including hypotheses.
	\item Determine if the Intermediate Value Theorem applies.
	\item Sketch pictures indicating why the Intermediate Value Theorem is true, and why all hypotheses are necessary.
        \item  Explain why certain points exist using the Intermediate Value Theorem.
\end{itemize}
