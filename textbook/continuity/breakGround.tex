habits of their cats.

\maketitle

Check out this dialog between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{Devyn}] Yo Riley, I was watching my two cats
    \textit{Roxy} and \textit{Yuri} eat their dry cat food last night.
\item[\textbf{Riley}] Cats love food!
\item[\textbf{Devyn}] I know! I noticed something kinda funny though:
  Both Roxy and Yuri eat at the same time; and while I gave Roxy a
  little more food than Yuri, less food was left in Roxy's dish when
  they stopped eating.

  I wonder, is there is a point in time when Roxy and Yuri have the
  exact same amount of \textbf{dry cat food} in their dishes?
\item[\textbf{Riley}] Hmmmmm. Do Roxy and Yuri both drink their water
  at the same time?  And does Roxy start with a little more water than
  Yuri, and finish with less water left than Yuri?
  \item[\textbf{Devyn}] Yes!
\item[\textbf{Riley}] Interesting. I wonder, is there is a point in
  time when Roxy and Yuri have the exact same amount of \textbf{water}
  in their dishes?
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
  Is there a time when Roxy and Yuri have the same amount of dry cat
  food in their dish assuming:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item They start and stop eating at the same times.
  \item Roxy starts with more food than Yuri, and leaves less food uneaten than Yuri. 
  \end{enumerate}

  Is there a time when Roxy and Yuri have the same amount of water in
  their dish assuming:

  \item Roxy starts with more water than Yuri, and leaves less water
    left in her dish than Yuri.

  Within the context of the two problems above, what is the difference
  between ``dry cat food'' and ``water?''

  you have your questions, label them as ``Level 1,'' ``Level 2,'' or
  ``Level 3'' where:

\item[Level 1] Means you know the answer, or know exactly how to do
  this problem.
\item[Level 2] Means you think you know how to do the problem, or will
  soon learn how to do the problem.
