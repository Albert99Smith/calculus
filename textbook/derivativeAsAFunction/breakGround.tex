\title[Break-Ground:]{Derivative as a function}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
A dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss derivatives as a function.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

% Dialogue: this homework problem is so boring
% why?
% I'm doing the same thing over and over again
% Just replace the thing by a VARIABLE!
% Does that work?

% Names of variables are a potential point of confusion.
% Get students to understand that we're simultaneously evaluating the derivative at multiple points

% Continuity at a point, derivative at a point

% Embed the Khan Academy activity where students build the derivative by computing tangent lines at multiple points
% Build graph and connect dots with more computation
