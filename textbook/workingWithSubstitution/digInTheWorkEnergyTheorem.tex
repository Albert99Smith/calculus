Let:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s(t)$ represent position with respect to time,
\item $v(t)$ represent velocity with respect to time,
\item $a(s)$ represent acceleration with respect to position,
\item $t_0$ represent the starting time,
\item $t_1$ represent the ending time,
\end{itemize}
then we also have that
\begin{itemize}
\item $s(t_0)$ represents the starting position,
\item $s(t_1)$ represents the ending position,
\item $v(t_0)$ represents the starting velocity,
\item $v(t_1)$ represents the ending velocity.
\end{itemize}

\[
W = \int_{s_0}^{s_1} %blah blah
