Two students discuss organizing the process of using the chain rule in reverse.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

% Emphasis how many differentiation formulas we have.

% We have chain rule.  What's chain rule backwards?

% Start with some easy cases where we can guess, and then try to formalize the process of organizing the chain rule in reverse.

%% we'll find the substitution formula, and then explain the different methods... or some such.
