\section{Velocity and displacement, speed and distance}

\begin{definition}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $v(t)$ is the velocity of an object at time $t$. This
    represents the ``change in position'' at time $t$.
  \item $s(t)$ is the positin of an object at time $t$. This gives
    location with respect to the origin. If we can assume that $s(a)
    = 0$, then
    \[
    s(t) = \int_a^t v(x) \d x.
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\item $s(b) -s(a)$ is the displacement, the distance btween the
  starting and finishing locations.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $|v(t)|$ is the \dfn{speed}.
  \item $\int_a^b |v(t)| \d t$ is the \dfn{distance} traveled.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Consider the following velocity plot... something like $sin(x)$ on $[0,2\pi]$. 
\end{example}



\section{Average value}

Conceptualizing definite integrals as ``signed area'' works great as
long as one can actually visualize the ``area.'' In some cases, a
better metaphore for integrals comes from the idea of \textit{average
  value}.  Looking back to your days as an even younger mathematician,
you may recall the idea of an \textit{average}:
\[
\frac{f_1+f_2+\dots+f_n}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n f_i
\]
If we want to know the average value of a function, a naive approach
might be to partition the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ equally spaced
subintervals, 
\[
a=x_0 < x_1 < \dots < x_{n}=b
\]
and choose any $x_k^*$ in $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$. The average of $f(x_1^*)$,
$f(x_2^*)$, \dots, $f(x_n^*)$ is:
\[
\frac{f(x_1^*) + f(x_2^*) + \dots + f(x_n^*)}{n} = \frac1n\sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*).
\]
Multiply this last expression by $1 = \frac{(b-a)}{(b-a)}$:
\begin{align*}
  \frac1n\sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*) &= \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*)\frac1n \\
  &= \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*)\frac1n \frac{(b-a)}{(b-a)} \\
  &= \frac{1}{b-a} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*)\frac{b-a}n  \\
  &=\frac{1}{b-a} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*)\Delta x
\end{align*}
where $\Delta x = (b-a)/n$.  Ah! On the right we have a Riemann Sum!
Now take the limit as $n\to\infty$:
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{b-a} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*)\Delta x = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x)\d x.
\]
This leads us to our next definition:

\begin{definition}
  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$. The \dfn{average value} of $f$ on
  $[a,b]$ is given by
  \[
  \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\d x.
  \]
\end{definition}

The average value of a function gives the height of a single rectangle whose area is equal to
\[
\int_a^b f(x) \d x
\]
\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[
      declare function = {f(\x) = -sin(deg(\x)) + 3;}]
    \begin{axis}[  
        domain=-.2:7, xmin =-.2,xmax=7,ymax=5,ymin=-.7,
        width=6in,
        height=3in,xtick={1,6},
        xticklabels={$a$,$b$},
        ytick style={draw=none},
        yticklabels={},
        axis lines=center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
        every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
        every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
        axis on top,
      ]
      \foreach \rectnumber in {1}
               {
                 \addplot [draw=penColor,fill=fillp] plot coordinates
                          {({1+(\rectnumber - 1) * 5},{3.08})
                            ({1+(\rectnumber) * 5},{3.08})} \closedcycle;
               };
               \addplot [very thick,penColor, smooth] {f(x)};
               \node[black] at (axis cs:3.5,1.5) {\huge$\int_a^b f(x) \d x$};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

An application of this definition is given in the next example.


\begin{example}
An object moves back and forth along a straight line with a velocity
given by $v(t) = (t-1)^2$ on $[0,3]$, where $t$ is measured in seconds
and $v(t)$ is measured in ft/s.

What is the average velocity of the object?
\begin{explanation}
By our definition, the average velocity is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{3-0}\int_0^3 (t-1)^2\d t &=\frac13 \int_0^3 t^2-2t+1\d t\\
&= \frac13\eval{\frac{t^3}{3}-t^2+t}_0^3\\
&= 1\text{ ft/s}.
\end{align*}
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

We can understand the above example through a simpler
situation. Suppose you drove $100$ miles in $2$ hours. What was your
average speed? The answer is simple:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time}} &= \frac{100~\text{miles}}{2~\text{hours}}\\
  &= 50~\text{mph.}
\end{align*}






\section{Mean value theorem for integrals}

Just as we have a Mean Value Theorem for Derivatives, we also have a
Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.


\begin{theorem}[The Mean Value Theorem for integrals]
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$. There exists a value $c$ in $[a,b]$
such that
\[
\int_a^bf(x)\d x = f(c)(b-a).
\]
\end{theorem}

This is an \emph{existential} statement. The Mean Value Theorem for
Integrals tells us:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{The average value of a continuous function is in the range of
  the function.}
\end{quote}


We demonstrate the principles involved in this version of the Mean
Value Theorem in the following example.

\begin{example}%%%BADBAD we state that this is an existential thm, then we ask for the value!
  Consider $\int_0^\pi \sin x \d x$. Find a value $c$ guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem.
  \begin{explanation}
    We first need to evaluate $\int_0^\pi \sin x\d x$.
    \[
    \int_0^\pi\sin x\d x =\eval{-\cos x}_0^\pi = 2.
    \]
    Thus we seek a value $c$ in $[0,\pi]$ such that $\pi\sin c =2$. 
    \[
    \pi\sin c = 2\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \sin c = 2/\pi\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ c = \arcsin(2/\pi) \approx 0.69.
    \]
    A graph of $y=\sin x$ on $[0,\pi]$ and the rectangle guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}
In Figure \ref{fig:ftc8} $\sin x$ is sketched along with a rectangle
with height $\sin (0.69)$. The area of the rectangle is the same as
the area under $\sin x$ on $[0,\pi]$. 

Let $f$ be a function on $[a,b]$ with $c$ such that $f(c)(b-a) =
\int_a^bf(x)\d x$. Consider $\int_a^b\big(f(x)-f(c)\big)\d x$:
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b\big(f(x)-f(c)\big)\d x &= \int_a^b f(x) - \int_a^b f(c)\d x\\
  &= f(c)(b-a) - f(c)(b-a) \\
  &= 0.
\end{align*}
When $f(x)$ is shifted by $-f(c)$, the amount of area under $f$ above
the $x$--axis on $[a,b]$ is the same as the amount of area below the
$x$--axis above $f$; see Figure \ref{fig:ftc9} for an illustration of
this. In this sense, we can say that $f(c)$ is the \textit{average
  value} of $f$ on $[a,b]$.


Finally, in (c) the height of the rectangle is such that the area of
the rectangle is \textit{exactly} that of $\int_0^4 f(x)\d x$. Since
rectangles that are ``too big'', as in (a), and rectangles that are
``too little,'' as in (b), give areas greater/lesser than $\int_1^4
f(x)\d x$, it makes sense that there is a rectangle, whose top
intersects $f(x)$ somewhere on $[1,4]$, whose area is \textit{exactly}
that of the definite integral.
