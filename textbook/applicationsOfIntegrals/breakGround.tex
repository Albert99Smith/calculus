Students discuss possible applications of integrals.

\maketitle


Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I've been thinking about integrals.
\item[Riley] I feel so fancy when I make an integral sign.
\item[Devyn] I know!
\item[Riley] An integral computes the signed area between a curve
  $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis. What sorts of problems can we solve with
  this?
\item[] %% now just make an impressive list with some sort of reason
        %% why it should work...
