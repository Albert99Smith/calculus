In the real world, mathematics usually deals with approximate (as opposed to exact) figures.

When you are weighing a rod of plutonium, estimating the speed and angle of a rocket being launched, or measuring the electrical conductivity of a person, you can never get an exact value.  Ones measurements always come with an error tolerance.

When these measurements are are used in subsequent calculations, it is important to be able to understand how these errors will propogate.  What starts of as a small measurement error could end up being an unacceptably large error in the outputs.  How do we know if we have measured the angle of the rocket well enough to ensure it will not crash, for instance?

Thus we often need to be able to compute the allowable tolerance for the inputs to generate an acceptable error in the outputs.

\begin{question}
  A box has length $100$ cm, width $20$ cm, and height $30$ cm, but I can only guarentee that these measurements are accurate to within one centimeter.  
  
\begin{question}
    The least the volume of this box could be is \answer{99*19*29} $\textrm{cm}^3$
      \begin{hint}
        The smallest dimensions this box could actually have given the estimates on the edge lengths are a length $99$ cm, width $19$ cm, and height $29$ cm
      \end{hint}
      \begin{hint}
        So the smallest the volume of the box could be is $99 \times 19 \times 29 = 54549 \textrm{ cm}^3$
      \end{hint}
  \end{question}
  
  \begin{question}
    The greatest the volume of this box could be is \answer{101*21*31} $\textrm{cm}^3$
      \begin{hint}
        The greastest dimensions this box could actually have given the estimates on the edge lengths are a length $101$ cm, width $21$ cm, and height $31$ cm
      \end{hint}
      \begin{hint}
        So the smallest the volume of the box could be is $101 \times 21 \times 31 = 65751 \textrm{ cm}^3$
      \end{hint}
  \end{question}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  I need a box with volume $60000 \textrm{ cm}^3$, and I need its length to be $100$ cm, its width to be $20$ cm, and its height to be $30$ cm.  Moreover, I need the volume to be accurate to within one cubic centimeter (say, to comply with FDA labeling laws).  Which of the following would be acceptable levels of error for the inputs?  Choose all that apply.
  
  \begin{multipleResponse}
    \choice{$\frac{1}{1000} \textrm{ cm}$}
    \choice{$\frac{1}{5000} \textrm{ cm}$}
    \choice[correct]{$\frac{1}{10000} \textrm{ cm}$}
    \choice[correct]{$\frac{1}{10000} \textrm{ cm}$}
  \end{multipleResponse}
  
  \begin{hint}
    If the error for my inputs is $\delta$, then the range of possible outputs for the volume of the box is $[(100-\delta(20-\delta)(30-\delta),(100+\delta)(20+\delta)(30+\delta)]$
  \end{hint} 
  
  \begin{hint}
    Plugging in $\delta = \frac{1}{1000}, \frac{1}{5000}, \frac{1}{10000}, \frac{1}{100000}$, we get ranges of outputs of approximately  $[59994.4, 60005.6]. [59998.8,60001.1],[59999.4, 60000.5]$ and $[59999.9, 60000.05]$ respectively. 
  \end{hint}
  
  \begin{hint}
    Of these, only the last two have outputs ranges within the acceptable tolerance of error.
  \end{hint}
\end{question}
