In the real world, mathematics usually deals with approximate (as opposed to exact) figures.

When you are weighing a rod of plutonium, estimating the speed and angle of a rocket being launched, or measuring the electrical conductivity of a person, you can never get an exact value.  Ones measurements always come with an error tolerance.

When these measurements are are used in subsequent calculations, it is important to be able to understand how these errors will propogate.  What starts of as a small measurement error could end up being an unacceptably large error in the outputs.  How do we know if we have measured the angle of the rocket well enough to ensure it will not crash, for instance?

Thus we often need to be able to compute the allowable tolerance for the inputs to generate an acceptable error in the outputs.

  A box has length $100$ cm, width $20$ cm, and height $30$ cm, but I can only guarentee that these measurements are accurate to within one centimeter.
