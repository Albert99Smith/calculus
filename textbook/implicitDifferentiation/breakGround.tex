  Two young mathematicians discuss differential equations.

\maketitle

% Thinking about unit circle

% Locally, even nonfunctions look like functions.

% $x^2 = y^2$ has two intersecting tangent lines

% Race cars on figure eight track, which spectators die?

% How do these differ from differentiating parametric equations?

% When does implicit differentiation work?

% Robot arm interactive

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I think we've been too explicit with each
  other. We should try to be more implicit.
\item[Riley] I. Um. Don't really\dots
\item[Devyn] Oh! I mean when plotting things!
\item[Riley] Ok, but I still have no idea what you are talking about.
\item[Devyn] Remember when we first learned the equation of a line, and the ``standard form'' was
  \[
  ax+by = c
  \]
  or something, which is totally useless for graphing. Also a circle is
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = r^2
  \]
  or something, and this isn't even $y$ as a function of
  $x$. Nevertheless, sometimes we plot these things.
\item[Riley] Ah, so if you have
  \[
  y = mx + b \rightleftaarow \text{where $y$ is \textbf{explicitly} a function of $x$}
  \]
  or you have
    \[
  ax + by = c  \rightleftaarow \text{here $y$ is \textbf{implicitly} a function of $x$.}
  \]
