\maketitle

% Start story with definite integral

% Something with constant jacobian like $e^{3x}$

% Do this calculation by thinking about definite integrals.

% How would you ever know that substitution worked for definite integrals without the fundamental theorem?

% Relate antiderivative and fundamental theorem of calculus

% Why are limits changing?

% What happens when the substituted function is not a bijection?

% Break down this into a "bonus" section?
