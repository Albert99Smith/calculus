Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley! I think we know more derivatives than we currently know.
\item[Riley] Oh you must tell me what you are thinking.
\item[Devyn] Well, it seems to me that almost all trig functions are
  basically built from sine.
\item[Riley] Right,
  \[
  \tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}
  \]
  and I'm thinking for everything else, we can use a triangle:

The pattern
\[
  \text{if} \qquad f(x) = x^n\quad\text{then}\qquad f'(x) = n\cdot x^{n-1}
\]
holds whenever $n$ is a constant. Explaining why it works in
generality will take some time. For now, let's see if we can use the
problem to squash some derivatives with ease.

\begin{problem}
  Using the pattern found above, compute:
  \[
  \ddx x^{101} \begin{prompt}= \answer{101 x^{100}}\end{prompt}
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Using the pattern found above, compute:
  \[
  \ddx \frac{1}{x^{77}} \begin{prompt}= \answer{-77 x^{-78}}\end{prompt}
  \]
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
  Using the pattern found above, compute:
  \[
  \ddx \sqrt[5]{x} \begin{prompt}= \answer{x^{-4/5}/5}\end{prompt}
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Using the pattern found above, compute:
  \[
  \ddx x^e  \begin{prompt}= \answer{e x^{e-1}}\end{prompt}
  \]
\end{problem}
