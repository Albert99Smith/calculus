\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we see a dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss stars,
limits, and instantaneous velocity.

\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, did you know I like looking at the stars at night?
\item[Riley] Stars are freaking awesome balls of nuclear fire whos
  light took thousands of years to reach us.
\item[Devyn] I know! But did you know that the best way to see a very
  dim star is to look \textbf{near} it but \textbf{not exactly at} it? It's
  because then you can use the ``rods'' in your eye, which work better
  in low light than the ``cones'' in your eyes.
\item[Riley] That's amazing! Hey! That reminds me of something\dots
  limits.
\item[Devyn] What! How?
\item[Riley] Limits are a way for us to understand the behavior of a
  function at a point, by examining the function \textbf{near} that point, but
  \textbf{not exactly at} that point.
\item[Devyn] O.M.G.\ Life's a rich tapestry.
\item[Riley] Poet, you know it.
\item[Devyn] But how does this happen in mathematics?
\item[Riley] Well think about how a GPS, or your phone, computes
  instantaneous velocity from position. It's just:
  \[
  \frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}}
  \]
\item[Devyn] And then it takes the \textit{limit} as the ``change in
  time'' goes to zero!
\item[Riley] Boom.
