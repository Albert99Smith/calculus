\title[Break-Ground:]{A limitless dialogue}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we see a dialogue where limits are computed using derivatives.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Yo Riley, guess what I did last night?
\item[Riley] What?
\item[Devyn] I was doing some calculus.
\item[Riley] That. Is. Awesome.
\item[Devyn] I know! Anyway, I noticed something kinda funny. I
  think you can sometimes take limits by taking the derivative of the
  numerator and the denominator.
\item[Riley] That's crazy.
\item[Devyn] I know! But check it:
  \begin{align*}
    \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} &= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\dd{x}\sin(x)}{\dd{x}x}\\
    &= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{1}\\
    &=1.
  \end{align*}
  \item[Riley] Woah. That. Is. Awes\dots weird. Hmmm, but it seems like
    cheating. Wait, it doesn't always work, check this out:
    \[
    \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2+1}{x+1} = 1,
    \]
    but
    \begin{align*}
      \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\dd{x}\left(x^2+1\right)}{\dd{x}\left(x+1\right)} &=
      \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{2x}{1} \\
      &=2.
    \end{align*}
\end{dialogue}

\begin{problem}
  Write down \textbf{five} examples where this ``trick'' works, and
  \textbf{five} examples when it doesn't work.

\begin{problem}
  What is the pattern for when the ``trick'' works and when it does not work?
