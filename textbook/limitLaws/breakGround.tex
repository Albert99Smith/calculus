\title[Break-Ground:]{Arithmetic of large and small}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we see a dialogue where we investigate the arithmetic of large and small numbers.

\maketitle


Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Hey Riley, remember when we did stuff with
  \textit{numbers} in math class?
\item[Riley] Oh the glory years! Now all we have are $a$, $b$, $c$, and $x$, $y$, $z$.
\item[Devyn] I know! Here's my crazy ideas, let's replace those  $a$, $b$, $c$'s, and $x$, $y$, $z$'s with ``large'' and ``small.''
\item[Riley] Wow. So you could do things like:
  \[
  \text{large}+\text{small}\qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{\text{small}}{\text{large}}
  \]
\end{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] And maybe
  \[
  \text{large}+\text{small} = \text{large}
  \]
  because the answer is still ``large.''
\item[Riley] Right! And maybe
  \[
  \frac{\text{small}}{\text{large}} = \text{small}
  \]
   because a small number divided by a large number is even smaller, and hence ``small.''
  
Big number times big number is big number.
Big number plus big number is big number
Big number dividied by big number is ??
