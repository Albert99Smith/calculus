\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we see a dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss differentiation.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] I hate the limit definition of derivative.  I wish there
  were a shorter way.
\item[Riley] I think I might have found a pattern for taking
  derivatives.
\item[Devyn] Really? I love patterns!
\item[Riley] I know! If we have a function
  \[
  f(x) = x^n\quad\text{then}\qquad f'(x) = n\cdot x^{n-1}
  \]
\item[Devyn] Hmmm does it work with square roots?
\item[Riley] Oh that's right
  \[
  f(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}
  \]
  So a square root is of the form $x^n$.
\item[Devyn] Let's check it. If $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$,
  \begin{align*}
    f'(x) \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\sqrt}
  \end{align*}
  
\end{dialogue}

% Does it work with square roots?

% Right! We can write square roots as x^(1/2)
