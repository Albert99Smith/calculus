\title[Break-Ground:]{Optimization}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we see a dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss optimization from an abstract point of view.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Find the max and min on a given domain.  You need to check endpoints.

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students:

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] 
What's the point of all these derivatives?
\item[Riley]
What's the smallest positive number?
I'm going to optimize something on an open interval.  Oh so many problems.
\end{dialogue}

Some sort of puzzle around finding a pair of numbers with positive product and maximum sum.

Still need to force them to consider a fixed domain.

Maxs and mins always appear at the midpoint.
