\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Solve basic word problems involving maxima or minima.
	\item Recognize optimization problem.
        \item Describe the goals of optimization problems generally.
        \item Recognize real-world failures of short-term versus long-term optimization.
	\item Find all local maximums and minimums using the First and Second Derivative tests.
	\item Identify when we can find an absolute maximum or minimum on an open interval.
	\item Contrast optimization on open and closed intervals.
        \item Identify the appropriate domain for functions which are models of real-world phenomena. 
        \item Translate a word problem into the problem of finding the extreme values of a function.
	\item Describe the objective function and constraints in a given optimization problem.
	\item Solve optimization problems by finding the appropriate extreme values.
\end{itemize}
