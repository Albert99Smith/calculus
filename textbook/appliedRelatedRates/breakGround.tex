Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

%% Right Triangle
%% Oil Spill

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Hey Riley, do you know what I love?
\item[Riley] Calculus? 
\item[Devyn] And pancakes! I really like to pour a lot of maple syrup
  on my pancakes.
\item[Riley] Mmmmmmm. Calculus. 
\item[Devyn] I know! So suppose you are pouring maple syrup on your
  pancake at a constant rate. You see it forming a disk that's expanding.
\item[Riley] Mmmmmmm. Sweet calculus. Wait! How fast is the radius of
  the disk of syrup expanding?
\end{dialogue}

To solve the problem above, we will need to solve a related-rates
problem. However, for now let's see if we can simply reason through
some problems.

\begin{problem}
  When comparing the volume of the maple syrup to the radius of the
  disk it forms, why might someone say that
  \begin{quote}
    The volume is proportional to the area of the disk.
  \end{quote}
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Because we sound smarter when we say ``proportional.''}
    \choice[correct]{Because $V = h\cdot A$ where $h$ is the height of the disk.}
    \choice{Because volume and area are related.}
    \choice{Trick question! Nobody would ever say this.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
