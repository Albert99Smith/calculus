Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

%% Right Triangle
%% Oil Spill

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Hey Riley, do you know what I love?
\item[Riley] Calculus? 
\item[Devyn] And pancakes! I really like to pour a lot of maple syrup
  on my pancakes.
\item[Riley] Mmmmmmm. Calculus. 
\item[Devyn] I know! So suppose you are pouring maple syrup on your
  pancake and you see that the radius of your maple syrup disk is
  expanding at $2$ centimeters per second.
\item[Riley] I wonder how much syrup we are using then?
\item[Devyn] Well, if we take the area of the disk of maple syrup and
  multiply it by some height, say $h$, that will give us a rough
  approximation of how much syrup is on the pancake.
\item[Riley] Right, and the area of a disk is
  \[
  A = \pi \cdot r^2
  \]
\item[Devyn] So now we have some formula
  \[
 A\cdot h = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h 
  \]
\end{dialogue}

Suppose we assume that the amount of oil is proportional to the surface area of the oil spill.
