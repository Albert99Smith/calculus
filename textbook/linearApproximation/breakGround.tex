\title[Break-Ground:]{Linear approximation}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Here we see a dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss linear approximation.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Lost hiker?

Procedural questions: how to approximate functions.

What is square root of 2.1?

Differentials?

% Right before the linear approximation section is the mean value
% theorem.  So I think the main story should be the extent to which
% second derivatives (acceleration) move you away from being a
% straight line.

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] 
What's the point of all these derivatives?
\item[Riley]
What's the smallest positive number?
I'm going to optimize something on an open interval.  Oh so many problems.
