\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Define linear approximation as an application of the tangent to a curve.
	\item Find the linear approximation to a function at a point and use it to approximate the function value.
	\item Identify when a linear approximation can be used.
	\item Label a graph with the appropriate quantities used in linear approximation.
	\item Find the error and approximate error of a linear approximation.
	\item Understand how good an approximation is.
	\item Use the second derivative to discuss whether the linear approximation over- or under-estimates the actual function value.
	\item Define a differential.
\end{itemize}
