  A dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss differential equations.

\maketitle

% Misconception: difference between equation versus function

% Find solutions to functional equations

% I'm thinking of a function whose derivative is three times that function.

% It must be zero!

% Well that wasn't what I was thinking of.

% e^(3x)

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, check out this book, it has some cool applications
  of calculus:
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{infect}'(x) &= 0.000004 \cdot \mathrm{suscept}(x) \cdot \mathrm{infect}(x) - 0.047\cdot \mathrm{infect}(x),\\
  \mathrm{suscept}'(x)&= -0.000004 \cdot \mathrm{suscept}(x) \cdot \mathrm{infect}(x).
\end{align*}
Where $\mathrm{infect}(x)$ is the number of infected people on day
$x$, and $\mathrm{suscept}(x)$ is the number of susceptible people on
day $x$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why the two formulas above are reasonable, though you
  don't need to worry about the precise values of the coefficients.
\item Discuss the outlook on day $13$ if you know
  $\mathrm{suscept}(13) = 5028$ and $\mathrm{infect}(13) = 4012$. In
  particular, you should talk about both $\mathrm{infect}'(x)$ and
  $\mathrm{suscept}'(x)$.
\item Compute $\mathrm{infect}''(x)$ on day 13. What does this say
  about the outlook?
\end{enumerate}
  
  where
  \[
  f''(x) = -f(x) \qquad\text{and}\qquad f(0) = 0.
  \]
\item[Riley] Hmmm. So something like sine or cosine\dots
