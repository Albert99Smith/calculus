\section{Why sigma notation?}

The notation
\[
\sigma_{k = 1}^n f(k) 
\]
may look pretty scary, but if you just relax, you can do it.

In words this expression says:


If you are someone who is interested in computers, here is pseudocode
that performs the same operation as our expression above.

S = 0
For k from 1 to n,  S <= S + f(k)
Return S

%%BADBAD should we do a python exercise here?
