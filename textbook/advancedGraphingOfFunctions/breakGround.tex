% Synthesis of everything we've learned

% We've learned so much stuff!
% Can't we put this all together somehow?

% Let's make a concept map of everything we've learned so far.

% Holes, point discontinuities, review from limits at the beginning

Here we see a dialogue where two young mathematicians discussing how
to sketch the plots of functions.

\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I've been thinking about the derivative. 
\item[Riley] It's all about change. It's some ``change-detector'' tool
  for math.
\item[Devyn] I know!  What's crazy is that you can use it as a tool
  for sniffing out dirt on functions.
\item[Riley] $f'$ tells us increasing or decreasing.
\item[Devyn] $f''$ tells us concavity.
\item[Riley] From just that we know all local maxs and mins.
\item[Devyn] And if we use limits, we can find asymptotes!
\item[Riley] You know, I'd like to make up a proceedure based on all
  these facts, that would tell me how to plot functions.
\item[Devyn] Me too! Let's get to work!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{problem}%% BADBAD This is a good problem. How do we do it?
  Below is a list of features of a plot of a function.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find local extrema.
  \item Find critical points.
  \item Identify inflection points and concavity.
  \item Determine an interval that shows all relevant behavior. \item Find any vertical asymptotes.
  \item Compute $f''(x)$.
  \item If possible, find the $x$-intercepts.
  \item Find the $y$-intercept.
  \item Compute $f'(x)$.
  \item Find intervals of increasing/decreasing behavior.
  \item Find horizontal asymptotes.
  \item Find candidates for inflection points.
 \end{enumerate}
  What is a good order to do this in? For example, one must compute $f'(x)$ before they compute $f''(x)$. Also, one must compute $f'(x)$ before they find the critical points.
