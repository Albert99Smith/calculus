% Synthesis of everything we've learned

% We've learned so much stuff!
% Can't we put this all together somehow?

% Let's make a concept map of everything we've learned so far.

% Holes, point discontinuities, review from limits at the beginning

Here we see a dialogue where two young mathematicians discussing how
to sketch the plots of functions.

\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I've been thinking about the derivative. 
\item[Riley] It's all about change. It's some ``change-detector'' tool
  for math.
\item[Devyn] I know!  What's crazy is that you can use it as a tool
  for sniffing out dirt on functions.
\item[Riley] $f'$ tells us increasing or decreasing.
\item[Devyn] $f''$ tells us concavity.
\item[Riley] From just that we know all local maxs and mins.
\item[Devyn] And if we use limits, we can find asymptotes!
\item[Riley] You know, I'd like to make up a proceedure based on all
  these facts, that would tell me how to plot functions.
\item[Devyn] Me too! Let's get to work!
