\title[Break-Ground:]{Approximating area under the curve}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
A dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss connections between
area and velocity.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

% Introduce Riemann sums as an approximation of antiderivatives

% Think more broadly than area under the curve

% Think about multiplication: we don't just do an "area" or "array" model for multiplication

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I've have a troubling question.
\item[Riley] Yes? 
\item[Devyn] What is area?
\item[Riley] Oh, for a rectangle it is just
  \[
  \text{width}\times \text{height}
  \]
\item[Devyn] Right. But shouldn't it mean more?
\end{dialogue}

Area is a funny thing. What is it really? Well the idea is this:
Define something as having a ``unit'' area, and see how many times it
``covers'' something.

The most obivious thing to use for our ``unit'' area is a unit
square. From this we can quickly move on to find the area of any
rectangle as 
  \[
  \text{width}\times \text{height}
  \]
  \begin{problem}
    Which models for area are most correct?
    \begin{selectAll}
      
    \end{selectAll}
  \end{problem}
