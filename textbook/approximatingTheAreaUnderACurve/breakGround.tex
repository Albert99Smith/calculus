\title[Break-Ground:]{Approximating area under the curve}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
A dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss approximating area.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

% Introduce Riemann sums as an approximation of antiderivatives

% Think more broadly than area under the curve

% Think about multiplication: we don't just do an "area" or "array" model for multiplication
