\title[Break-Ground:]{Approximating area under the curve}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
A dialogue where two young mathematicians discuss connections between
area and velocity.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

% Introduce Riemann sums as an approximation of antiderivatives

% Think more broadly than area under the curve

% Think about multiplication: we don't just do an "area" or "array" model for multiplication

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, if I know where I start, and I know how fast I am
  going, I should be able to figure out how far I've gone.
\item[Riley] Using calculus?
\item[Devyn] You know I love calculus, but I think we can do
  something simple here.
