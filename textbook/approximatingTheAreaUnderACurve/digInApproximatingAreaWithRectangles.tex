\begin{abstract}
  We introduce the basic idea of using rectangles to approximate the
  area under a curve.

\section{Limits and areas}





\section{But which set of rectangles?}

If we are going to try an actually use many small rectangles to
compute the area under a curve, we should decide on exactly
\textit{which} rectangles we want to use. Here are three options that
we consider:

\paragraph{Rectangles defined by a left endpoint}


\paragraph{Rectangles defined by a right endpoint}


\paragraph{Rectangles defined by a midpoint}


\section{Computing these approximations}


\paragraph{Rectangles defined by a left endpoint}


\paragraph{Rectangles defined by a right endpoint}


\paragraph{Rectangles defined by a midpoint}
