Two young mathematicians discuss the novel idea of the ``slope of a curve.''

\maketitle


Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, do you remember `slope?'
\item[Riley] Most definitely. ``Rise over run.''
\item[Devyn] You know it.
\item[Riley] ``Change in $y$ over change in $x$.''
\item[Devny] That's right.  
\item[Riley] ``m.''
\item[Devny] Enough! My important question, is could we define
  ``slope'' for a curve?
\item[Riley] Well maybe if we ``zoom in'' on a curve, it would look
  like a line, and then we could call it ``the slope at that point.''
\item[Devyn] Ah! And this ``zoom in'' idea sounds like a limit!
\item[Riley] This is so awesome. We just made math!
\end{dialogue}

The concept introduced above, of the ``slope of a curve at a point,''
is one it in fact is one of the central concepts of calculus. It will,
in course, be completely explaind.  Let's see if we can clarify Devyn
and Riley's ideas.


\begin{problem}
To find the ``slope of a curve at a point,'' Devyn and Riley spoke of
``zooming in'' on a curve until it looks like a line.
