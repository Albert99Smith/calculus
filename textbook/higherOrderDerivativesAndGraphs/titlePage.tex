\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Define higher order derivatives.
	\item Calculate higher order derivatives.
	\item Identify the relationships between the function and its first and second derivatives.
	\item Sketch a graph of the second derivative, given the original function.
	\item Sketch a graph of the original function, given the graph of its first and second derivatives.
	\item Interpret the second derivative of a position function as acceleration.
	\item State the relationship between concavity and the second derivative.
	\item Use the first derivative to determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing.
\end{itemize}
