Studying functions and their derivatives might seem somewhat
abstract. However, consider this passage from a physics book:
\begin{quote}
  Assuming acceleration $a$ is constant, we may write velocity and
  position as
  \begin{align*}
    v(t) &= v_0 + at,\\
    x(t) &= x_0 + v_0 t + (1/2) a t^2,
  \end{align*}
  where $v_0$ is the position at timne zero, and $x_0$ is the position
  at time zero.
\end{quote}
These equations model the position and velocity of a falling objects
and any other motion when acceleration is constant.




Calculus allows us to see the connection between these equations.
