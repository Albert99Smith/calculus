Imagine yourself as a ``mathematician-for-hire'' and that the
\mooculus\ Virtual-Reality squad has hired you (for points, not cash)
to build some VR demos. You will work in groups of four, where each
group member is responsible for modeling a specific demo:
\begin{itemize}
\item One group member will make a demo showing the intersection of a
  sphere and a plane.
\item One group member will make a demo showing the intersection of
  two planes.
\item One group member will make a demo showing two circles (a great
  circle and a regular circle) on a sphere.
\item One group member will make a demo showing two circles on a
  torus.
\end{itemize}
Finally, as a group, you must make a demo showing a mobius strip with
a tube hovering above the side.







\textbf{as a group} give an explanation of how
the orbits are derived. Specific details and questions are below.
\textbf{Your work will be graded on the basis of its quality as instructional
material.}  This assignment is due Friday, February 3rd, and should be
handed in as a report with, the group assignment first, and each
individual assignment added as an appendix.
