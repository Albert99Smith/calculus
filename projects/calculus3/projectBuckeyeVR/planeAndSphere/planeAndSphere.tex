\maketitle

One group member will produce a plot like this one:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{planeAndSphere.png}
\end{image}

This is the intersection of a sphere of radius $4$ centered at the origin with the plane $x=3$.

You need to reproduce this plot along with a circle at the
intersection. You may make the circle any color you wish.
