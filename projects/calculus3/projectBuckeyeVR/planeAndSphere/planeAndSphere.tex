\maketitle

One group member will produce a plot like this one:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{intersection.png}
\end{image}

This is the intersection of the plane
\[
-x-y+z=1\quad\text{and}\quad  x+z=1
\]
with the sphere
\[
????
\]
along with a circle at the intersection. You may make the line any
color you wish.
