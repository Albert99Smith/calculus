  \begin{itemize}
  \item $10\%$ for handing it in.
  \item $10\%$ for each correct ``object'' (each individual portion has exactly $3$ objects).
  \end{itemize}
\item $50\%$ for the group portion.

You will hand in \textbf{a single document} on Carmen. This document
will have six section headings, each identifying what is being plotted
(you can just use the title of the appropriate subassignment).  Under
each section you will include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The name(s) of the group members who worked on the section.
\item A QR code for the relevant plot generated from
  \link[this]{https://buckeyevr.osu.edu/plot/} site.
\item A URL for the relevant plot generated from
  \link[this]{https://buckeyevr.osu.edu/plot/} site.
\end{itemize}
