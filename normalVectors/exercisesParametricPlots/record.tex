\begin{exercise}
  A standard LP record is $12\unit{in}$ in diameter and spins at
  $33+\frac{1}{3}$ rotations per minute in a clockwise direction. An
  ant starts at the center of the record and walks to the edge
  (initially headed directly right, along a radius at
  $(1/4)\unit{in/sec}$. Working in inches and seconds, and assuming
  that the center of the record is at the origin,

  write a
  vector-valued function $\vec{a}$ that describes the ant's path.
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \vec{a}(t) = \vector{}
    \]
  \end{prompt}
\end{exercise}
