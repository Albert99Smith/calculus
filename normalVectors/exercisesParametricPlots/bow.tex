\begin{exercise}
  An archer is shooting at a target which is $40$ yards away. Her bow
  is at a height of $5\unit{ft}$, and she aims for the bullseye
  $4\unit{ft}$ above the ground. The bow fires arrows at $300
  \unit{ft/s}$. Assume that the arrow is fired from the point $(0,5)$
  and that the target is at the point $(40,4)$. Find a vector-valued
  function describing the path of the arrow from the bow to the
  bullseye of the target. Let the acceleration due to gravity be $-32
  \unit{ft}/\unit{s}^2$.
  \begin{hint}
    Let
    \[
    \uvec{u} = \vector{\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta)}
    \]
    be the direction that the arrow is fired in.
  \end{hint}
  \begin{hint}
    Let $t_{\text{target}}$ be the time that the arrow hits the
    target.  Express both $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$ in terms
    of $t_{\text{target}}$, then use the Pythagorean identity:
    \[
    \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1
    \]
    to solve for $t_{\text{target}}$.
  \end{hint}
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \vec{b}(t) = \vector{
      \answer{(t/4)\cos((33+1/3) 2\pi t/60)},
      \answer{(t/4)\sin((33+1/3) 2\pi t/60)}
    }
    \]
