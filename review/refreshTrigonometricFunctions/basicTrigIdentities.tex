\begin{exercise}
  When working problems involving integrals of products of trigonometric functions, it is necessary to use trigonometric identities to manipulate the expressions in the integrand.
  
  While all of the necessary trigonometric identities will be provided on exams and€‹ quizzes, you will need to know how to use them correctly to evaluate antiderivatives involving trigonometric functions.  It also saves you time on the exams if you are familiar enough to use identities without referring to the formula sheet.  

To gain some practice, answer the following questions.

  Write the following expressions in terms of either $\sin(x)$ or $\cos(x)$.
  \[
    \sec(x) \cot(x) = \answer{\frac{1}{\sin(x)}}
  \]

\[
\sin(2x) = \answer{2 \sin(x) \cdot \cos(x)}
\]

  Use the trigonometric identities to simplify $\frac{\tan(x)}{\sec(x)}$.  
  \[
    \frac{\tan(x)}{\sec(x)} = \answer{\sin(x)}
  \]
