Almost every problem we will see in this course will require precise arithmetic calculations and algebraic operations. In this problem we review the basic order of operations of arithmetic as well as the operation of completing the square.

\begin{problem}
  Compute
  \[
  9-16\cdot 0 + 8\div 2 = \answer{13}
  \]
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
  Find the missing quantities that complete the square:
  \[
   x^2 + 20x +\answer{100} = (\answer{x+10})^2 
   \]
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
  Find the missing quantities that complete the square:
  \[
  x^2-12x + \answer{36} = (x-6)^2
  \]
\end{problem}


\end{exercise}
