  Consider an astroid:
  \begin{image}
    Astroid
  \end{image}
  This curve is drawn by
  \[
  \vec{a}(t) = \vector{\cos^3(t), \sin^3(t)}
  \]
  as $t$ runs from $0$ to $2\pi$. Let $R$ be the region enclosed by
  this curve.
  

  Set $\vec{F}(x,y) = \vector{0,x}$ and set-up, but do not evaluate, a line integral computing the area of $R$.
  \[
  \iint_R\d A = \int_{\answer{}}^{\answer{}} \answer{} \d t
  \]
  

  Set $\vec{G}(x,y) = \vector{-y,0}$ and set-up, but do not evaluate, a line integral computing the area of $R$.
  \[
  \iint_R\d A = \int_{\answer{}}^{\answer{}} \answer{} \d t
  \]
  

  Set $\vec{H}(x,y) = \vector{-y/2,x/2}$ and set-up, but do not evaluate, a line integral computing the area of $R$.
  \[
  \iint_R\d A = \int_{\answer{}}^{\answer{}} \answer{} \d t
  \]
