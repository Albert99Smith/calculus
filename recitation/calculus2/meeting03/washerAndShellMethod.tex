\section{Discussion Questions}

\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[I.] The region bounded by $y=x$, $y=3x$, and $x=2$ is revolved about the line $x=5$. We wish to compute the volume of the resulting solid by integrating with respect to $x$. Which method (Washer or Shell) should be used to compute the volume?

\item[II.]  The region bounded by $y=\sqrt{x}$, $y=0$, $x=1$ and $x=4$ is revolved about the line $x=8$.  We wish to compute the volume of the resulting solid using the Washer Method. Which variable should we integrate with respect to in order to compute the volume?

\item[III.] The region bounded by $y=-e^x$, $y=0$, $x=1$ and $x=2$ is rotated about either a horizontal or a vertical line. Suppose that the volume of the resulting solid can be calculated using the Shell method, integrating with respect to $y$. Was the axis of rotation horizontal or vertical?

\begin{enumerate}
\item[I.] If $R$ is revolved about the line $x=-2$, what is the minimum number of integrals required to express the volume of the resulting solid if the Washer method is used?  What if the Shell method is used?

\item[II.] If $R$ is revolved about the line $y=5$, what is the minimum number of integrals required to express the volume of the resulting solid if the Washer method is used?  What if the Shell method is used?

\begin{problem}
Let $R$ be the region bounded by $y=\sin (x)$, $y=0$, $x=\frac{\pi}{4}$ and $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$. For each of the following cases, set up (but don't evaluate) integrals which could be used to calculate the volume of the given solid using both the Shell method and the Washer method.
