\begin{question}
Suppose that $F(x,y) = 4xy+3y^2+3$.  

Are there any values of $c$ where there is no level curve associated to $z=c$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes; the domain of $F$ is not all of $\R^2$}
\choice{No; the domain of $F$ is all of $\R^2$}
\choice{Yes; the range of $F$ is not all of $\R$}
\choice[correct]{No; the range of $F$ is all of $\R$}
\end{multipleChoice}
