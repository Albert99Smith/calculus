The launch should somehow present a ``mystery'' for the students to
solve.  Moreover, it should lead them to the right path. Ideally if we
had a bright student working on the launch, they might even develop
the techniques from the lesson to solve teh problem. 
By the end of the lesson, the mystery is solved!
